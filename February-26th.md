Morning of September 19th

We're a day early meeting Tefydarian, so we decide to explore the cave system. We go in the third hole (the first being the one Jim told us not to go into and the second being to the dragon).  We send Oz to scout, since he can fly. He looks through his owl's eyes, and just suddenly dies without seeing anything that would have killed it. 

We decide to explore the first cave, after learning that chuuls protect something of importance, repelling down the wall of the cave. Oz has proficiency in knots. Oz tosses a light rock down the hallway, and we see that the ground slopes up, which leads to a wall that we climb, and then slooooopes down significantly. We light a rock and throw it down. We see it roll and fall in a small body of water. Praetus gives me his shield, and I slide down, making a loud splash. Oz rides his wyrmling down, and brings the shield back up to Praetus who does the same. We go to the other side of the pond. We start forward and hear the sound of wings flapping. Oz scouts ahead, and it eventually opens into a room, and the flapping suddenly stops. Oz runs the fuck away, back to us. Praetus lights his sword and proceeds forward.

We enter the large room, skeletons litter the floor, still wearing heavy winter clothes. There also a great big stalagmite on the floor. As we approach it, we hear clacking, like claws. Oz's wyrmling roars and nothing happens. Praetus is rearranging the bodies and giving them their last rights. 5 minutes in, one of the coats leaps on me and engulfs me.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Cloaker tries to suffocate me. Praetus lights all the weapons. Oz fights with his wyrmling for the first time. We win.

Praetus continues doing what he was doing. Oz looks around the room and finds a hole where water is streaming from. He shimmies in. He goes up and down and eventually sees sunlight streaming through a hole in the wall. He turns back.

We go back down in the tunnel in the room, and after snaking around awhile, we see a point of light (Oz's light globe?). Something crunches it out. We advance into a large room with another large pool of water and a waterfall. Praetus sticks his light sword in the reflective pool of water, and there's a scurry of movement under the water. We go up some stairs in the room. A chuul pops his head up from the pool below us.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Epic finale: Praetus and myself are being choked up by a chuul, and all of a sudden, out of the blue, a small being on a dragon dives in the water and chops off the chuul's head. Oz real MVP.
