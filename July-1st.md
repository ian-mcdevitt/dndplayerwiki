Evening? Of September 28th

Not mentioned earlier, we make some caltrops out of nails as some extra ammo. We are going to leave 24 duergar invisible at our flank to take out additional forces in the birthing pools, and charge the labs. Caltrops dropped in front of the Elder Brain room entrance.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Huge battle. The Elder Brain enemies did not advance and are untouched. The remaining unaccounted for enemies went invisible and we eventually took them out. About half of our duergar are dead. We are all still alive, but hurting.
