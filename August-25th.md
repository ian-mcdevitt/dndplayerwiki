Morning of October 7th

Our escort's name is Alanar. Dammit. He informs it will take us several days to get to the Living Gate. Onward! Oz fiddles with polymorphing to go faster. I fiddle with binding and getting to know some of the spirit vestiges. Praetus prays to us.

We come across some owlbears devouring some wolves. They smell us.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Between hex and compulsion, we hurt a few in the process, but they were moved away. 

We continue forward. 2 more days pass without incident.

Morning of October 10th

We come to the edge of the forest. Lots of hills as far as the eye can see, the Fey analogue to the Plains of Ruskal. The Plains were the site of a massive battle, between two factions that were not native to the Prime Material. Ruins are scattered everywhere. It's a desert (<10in rain/yr), but grass still grows there. Praetus is fed up with this place's shit but is also having a little PTSD hearing the name, as he has fought Valerian War battles there. One of the factions that fought on the Ruskal Plains was illithid and beholders, the other faction vaguely humanoid. Alanar informs us we'll be at our destination within the day. We go forward toward the mountain range in the distance.

The terrain gets more jagged and raw. As we crest a hill, was see the Living Gate. It's square, crystalline, and jagged, hovering above the ground. Through the Gate is a starscape. As we draw closer, the tall grass becomes shorter, the Gate seemingly turning to face us, in all directions. Not to mention this thing is huge. Oz send his owl in, and it thunks against nothing and falls to the ground. Oz tries to talk to Adelum, saying that we can help and someone is trying to bring Utereshk back. Alanar calls him presumptuous, saying that it's insulting to call Adelum weak and thinking we can do something about it. 

I meditate and talk to Ushay. And he says that the Living Gate and the area beyond is a tumor on the bubble that he is. Utureshk was forced into her own demi-reality. Spirits belong inside the bubble. Binding works because the vestiges are outside the bubble and belong inside it, but spirits have a harder time getting out of the bubble. Adelum hasn't really communicated since he became the Gate, but ever since, the Living gate appearance has become rougher, to the point where pieces break off into Shardminds, sentient humanoid pieces of the Gate. There are a few theories about the Shardmind, about them being destroyers or being good and forming a massive being. Oz listens to the Gate, and hears millions of voices, seemingly making up this Gate. Oz attempts to find Utureshk's voice. After an hour, he cannot pinpoints Utureshk's voice, and determines she's not here. Oz also hears a voice that says “seek the trail,” slightly louder and more repetitive than the other voices he's hearing, as he's actively listening for a shard's voice.

Oz grabs the compass and wills it to show him the trail. It points to an area 50 feet west of the Gate. As we stand there, we notice nothing remarkable about this spot. Detect Magic reveals a faint trail of necromantic magic heading to the west. Follow it!
We're following parallel to the mountains, and I'm continuously casting Detect Magic, Oz is alternating. The path is windy as all hell. The ground gives way to swamp land, then marsh. The trail consistently stays in the water. 

I feel compelled to follow a pulsating light over to the left. As a I do so, Praetus makes me come to my senses. Damn wisps. Oz realizes the thought is not his own when it happens to him. Oz tries to hit it, and it fights back. It eventually flies off after a few hits.

We're exhausted, so we stop for the “night” in Oz's hut. 3 hours after we settle in the hut, we notice both of the suns set and it becomes dark, which is something that has not happened since we've been here. We go to sleep, in watches. During Oz's watch, an old man comes toward the hut, asking where the Living Gate is. Praetus tries to remove magical effects, and the old man's shapeshift drops. He's... an angel. He says he's “taking stock of the Gate” and proceeds to attack us.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

The angel disappears before we can render him unconscious. We go back to sleep.

About half an hour later, Oz sees a swamp monster peek out from the water, he dismisses it. And continually pops up at various locations around the hut. It whispers into Oz's mind, “You will all die.”  “Your friends will betray you.” “You will die screaming.” Oz ignores it, but lets Praetus know about it for his watch. The same thing happens with Praetus. 

Morning of October 11th

We wake up. Something whispers in our minds in a language that we cannot understand. Something pulls at Oz's mind, and the message is the same: dying and pain and betrayal. We ignore it and continue on the trail. It keeps changes by 90 degrees every 30 minutes or so... and eventually the path crosses again. We can't really do anything but keep going... Oz deduces that the trail we were following was about a week old, and the one that we are currently following is about 12 hours old. We keep going, but attempt to move faster. Oz tries to fly around to find the trail again in a different spot. Nothing.

Oz attempts to fly ahead of us, follows the trail. It circles the island that we slept on last night, and then the entire trail disappears. There is a hole under the water in a certain spot that goes very deep, where the trail also goes. I send to Oz asking him where he is, and Praetus and I make our way back. Oz casts water breathing and dives down he hole. Oz goes about 500 feet, gives up, and swims back up as we come back. Oz polymorphs into a giant squid, he gives us water breathing, and we swim down.

1200 feet down, we eventually reach a giant chamber with tunnels. There's no light but the water is clear. Detect magic reveals that all the tunnels have been entered, but two look fresher. We go into the first one. The tunnel has a current that's pulling us. We drop down a waterfall and into a chamber with air. There are two smaller tunnels on the far wall. There are also two small rowboats in the room. We vote to go to the right, with Oz the squid, pulling it. There's an iron post as well that the boat is tied to, which Praetus pulls out. Come to a bigger chamber, diffused trail, go down the northeast tunnel. 

We come to another chamber. There's a cage semi-submerged in water, with 12 eladrin inside, 4 of them lying face down dead, their hands scrambling outside the cage for a way out. We break them out of the cage and drag them to dry land. They have scars in the forehead the same that is scrawled on the walls of this room. They are exhausted and now unconscious. We send them through a teleportation circle to Jim's office, warning him first. Praetus cleanses the remaining bodies. Oz sets up his hut again and we rest.

During Oz's watch, 4 ice mephits float into the room and look at the ceiling where the cage is hanging from. They know there are bodies missing. They look around the room and see the hut. Oz polymorphs into a T-Rex and bites them. Praetus and I wake up and we kill them easily. We go back to sleep. 

Morning of October 12th

Praetus looks at the symbol, trying to figure out what it is. All he can deduce is that it's too simple to be a symbol for a single person. We backtrack into the previous chamber. We go down a waterfall, into another cavern, filled with water, with an island in the middle filled with stalagmites and a face down corpse in the water. Praetus senses undead entities nearby. Oz inspects the dead body, and he looks like he's been dead for three days, and has a ring of keys on him. In the middle of island in the middle of a ring of stalagmites, is a drum. Oz throws a rock at it and nothing happens. Praetus finds manacles behind a gate with a lock and finds that the key on the ring works for them. He also finds a tunnel behind the gate. Since banging on the drum didn't yield any enemies, he decides to go into the tunnel.

Through the tunnel and into the next room. Eight bodies jump on Praetus upon entering the room. 

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We kill ghouls and a ghast. Praetus went down with that first round of attacks. Holy crap.

Oz sets up his hut again and we rest.
