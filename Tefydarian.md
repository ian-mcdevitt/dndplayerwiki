Tefydarian is a bronze dragon, that in a mad stupor kidnapped [[Lana Spiderbash]] from Evenbrook, [[Vincent]] from Riversmaw, and [[Keyleth Amastacia]] from Titanrock.

Upon entering his lair in the World Tree Caves, we found he was under some magic that caused him to go insane, believing his 3 babies were alive and well. The crown, we found, contains the souls of these three deformed wyrmlings.

The dragon also gave us some documents laying out some of the spirit history and Oz's lance.

Tefydarian is thankful that we broke the spell, but wary of being taken advantage of when we ask for more information about the chromative dragon insanity trend.
