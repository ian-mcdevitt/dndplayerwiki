SOLVED: Hakour

When Enna goes to explore the town, she comes across a family of dwarves with a very overgrown garden. The weeds and overgrowth is strangling the families edible plants, and every day, the overgrowth gets worse.

After talking to a member of the clergy, we find that it was magically and intentionally done to the families garden.

Jim the Wizard manages to dispell the magic, and it seems to work. For now.

Oz asks John Frostmantle to assist him with building a bridge so that the town of Evenbrook may expand their trade with other neighboring towns. He agrees and it is built in 3 days.

A few days later, we found the the bridge burned down and destroyed. We consulted Jim the Wizard about it who is flippant with the three of them, implying that since the three of them came to Evenbrook, a lot of trouble has come with us.

Illusory terrain was cast by Jim to produce a fake bridge. Jim alarms it and we stake it out. A weasel appears, setting off Jim's alarm. Praetus and Enna chase after it, eventually losing it, but find that these are not the normal actions of a weasel, but the way and direction it was running. We're thinking Druid, at this point.

John Farguard, captain of the town guard, says a lot of the events going on are consistent with a Druid (the garden, the bridge, etc). Actions were performed before dawn and are nature related.

Enna and Praetus go to investigate Duncan Commonshield about the Daybrook wereworlf attacks, who describes issues that started three months ago. He confirmed with a few stories of druid consistent incidences aw well.

We found on the night of the copper dragon attack that other things have happened to the town consistent with druid activity, even before we got here. One of the town's halflings expresses that beasts tend to attack the town, for no reason. Giant elk, bears, and now a dragon. There were crop failures due to locusts. There was a flood. And there was also a plague. One of the Firemaw sisters went crazy when she got sick from the plague and killed her brother and herself. A geas can explain these events, which further points us to druid activity.
