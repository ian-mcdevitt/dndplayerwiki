*Spirit of the Moon*

Zari is, literally, a giant pill bug, that is one of Zaralight's two moons.

History: Jyostna bought power to Zari, the moon spirit. Zari had a Chosen One named Chaundra who was powerful and good, and then when Zari fell in the Great War, she became the first lyncan and caused much destruction. Then Kaldaka was the redeemer, and resurrected Zari and was the last lycan.
