*Spirit of the Deepest Darkest Places*

Zari is, literally, a giant pill bug, that is one of Zaralight's two moons.

History: Jyostna bought power to Zari, the moon spirit. Zari had a Chosen One named Chaundra who was powerful and good, and then when Zari fell in the Great War, she became the first lyncan and caused much destruction. Then Kaldaka was the redeemer, and resurrected Zari and was the last lycan.

Zari Day is a celebration once a year, where the town celebrates the military excellence in raising a wall to keep the werewolves out. Celebrated by raising a wall, music and generally a good time.
