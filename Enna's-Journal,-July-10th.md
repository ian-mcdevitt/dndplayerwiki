First sessions:

*** 8 years since the Valerian War***
Acheuadi sent Enna a vision of the new continent, but needed a way to get there.
Oz was imprisoned on a ship traveling to a new area for arena fighting, along with 20 others.
Praetus wanted to liberate the slaves.
This is where the three of them met. They commandeered the ship and set sail to the new continent.
While on the ship, sahaugin (merfolk) attacked them. Both Oz and Praetus thought it would be a good idea to swim with armor on. It wasn't. Needless to say, the three of them fended the merfolk off.
After finding the coastline, they drifted along until they found evidence of a settlement. 
The villagers were curious but nonthreatening. We found out the name of the settlement was Evenbrook and the continent was called Tilrendis. 
We asked the villagers if it was okay for the slaves to make a new life in Evenbrook, to which they agreed. We decided that using the ship for lumber was the easiest way to obtain all the wood we would need. 
We explored the area and got to know the villagers. They seemed to be a diverse group of people, mostly friendly.
A slave and a child of the village went missing by the stream. Seemed to suggest a bipedal animal. We deduce it to be knolls.
We follow the tracks, hours worth to a sunken temple in the swamp.
Over the course of two days, we find the knolls in the temple, free the child and the slave, bring them back, go back to the temple, and explore it.
In there, we meet flumphs, who can change colors based on their emotions, fight off a huge psychically fucked up dark flumph (which we promptly kill), brains in jars, intellect devourers, and a mind flayer maze, which we promptly leave after a drunken Oz tries to maneuver his way through it and a voice tells us to leave.
We at one point stumble across a room that has 6 tablets in it. Upon reading the tablets, we find that each of them represents a spirit and a description of it.
Nysmund Amar
Rushieri
Turcerbelon
Akimeito
Rarharikle
Uire Nuir
One of the tablets has a piece missing from it, which we later find at the Evenbrook tavern. 
At the same time we find the tablet piece, we get some bidniz done:
	Oz started building a bridge (and by building asked Frostmantle, a town carpenter)
	Ideas about starting a trade route with other towns
	Killed a fang of Yeenoghu (with the gnolls back at the temple). The gnolls worship a very evil 	God, Yeenoghu, who likes killing things... this is why all the gnolls had to die. They tried to 	make nice, tried talking to them, they really did. They didn't listen. So they died.
The tablets circle around a soft of iris and the beams of light would open a hole in the floor. We replace the missing piece to find a man dressed in white lying on the ground.
We rouse him to find he cannot talk, but screams with his mind. He actually hurts us in the process of talking.
The man in white kills a grell, and looks horrified by what he is done, so much he casts silence on himself.

August 28th, 2015

We hop on the boat, across the lake. Sleep. We ask him again his name and where he is from now that he is calmer. He starts to carve symbols into a tree. Oz finds that comprehend languages reveals to be his name. After seeing a worked up, excited Praetus, he silences himself again. Seems a little PTSD, a reaction. His white clothes change to a white robe, slowly, over the course of the trip back.
We ask him what he remembers if anything. He writes out, in symbols, Utureshk
Utureshk, as far as Enna knows, has a link with the “Living Gate.” Has no idea what that is. 
Peter's abilities are similar to mind flayers. Is Peter an experiment? Is something residing in him?

Upon arriving back in town:
	Talked to Jim the wizard. 
	Enna got Jim to dispel magic the weed invested garden at the Bronzeleaf residence (which was 	discovered earlier when arriving in the town). Seems to work.

Found the bridge that Oz had John Frostmantle build burned and destroyed.
	Consulted Jim about that. Who is flippant with the three of them, implying that since the three 	of them came, a lot of trouble has come with us. 
	Illusory terrain was cast by Jim to produce a fake bridge. Jim alarms it and the three stake it 	out. A weasel appears. Praetus and Enna chase after it, eventually losing it, but find that these 	are not the normal actions of a weasel.

A man approaches Praetus about sheep attacks on his farm. Praetus goes to investigate a sheep carcass and finds that it is consistent with a werewolf attack. Praetus goes to the temple to consult with the other clerics. One confides in him that a man came to confess about being a werewolf.
Praetus distrusts one cleric in the temple, but not sure who yet (possibly Shae?)
Our house is done (so much planning, Seriously, funniest shit all night), we move in. 
A knock on the door reveals a woman in hysterics, her house destroyed. Windows broken, place ransacked. Family of ten dragonborns (the Firemaws) living in a two bedroom house. Is the magic the same? They even asked the neighbors (the Snowlights, tieflings).
Oz proceeds to help repair some of the home.
Enna goes to find Jim, and burns her face off trying to read his books.
Praetus goes on a picnic with Telsa. 
Enna goes fishing. Sees a vision of a man in white and a huge pill bug dying simultaneously, a man turning into a wolf, the pill bug's legs twitching, and the wolf reverting back into a man.
Praetus makes a cleric (Adrian Downwhisper): He has found a young man (Adrian) to carry on Lathander's teachings while he is gone.
As the three walk into town after Praetus' sermon, some locals start a fight to get us to leave town.
