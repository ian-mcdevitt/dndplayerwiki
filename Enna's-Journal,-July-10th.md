*8 years since the Valerian War*

August 16th

Acheuadi sent me a vision of the new continent, but needed a way to get there.
Oz was imprisoned on a ship traveling to a new area for arena fighting, along with 20 others. And Praetus wanted to liberate the slaves. This is where we met and we three commandeered the ship.

While on the ship, sahaugin (merfolk) attacked us. Both Oz and Praetus thought it would be a good idea to swim with armor on. It wasn't. Needless to say, We fended the merfolk off.

After finding the coastline, they drifted along until they found evidence of a settlement. 

The villagers were curious but nonthreatening. We found out the name of the settlement was Evenbrook and the continent was called Tilrendis. 

We asked the villagers if it was okay for the slaves to make a new life in Evenbrook, to which they agreed. We decided that using the ship for lumber was the easiest way to obtain all the wood we would need. 

We explored the area and got to know the villagers. They seemed to be a diverse group of people, mostly friendly.

A slave and a child of the village went missing by the stream. Seemed to suggest a bipedal animal. We deduce it to be gnolls.

We follow the tracks, hours worth to a sunken temple in the swamp.

Over the course of two days, we find the gnolls in the temple, free the child and the slave, bring them back, go back to the temple, and explore it.

In there, we meet flumphs, who can change colors based on their emotions, fight off a huge psychically fucked up dark flumph (which we promptly kill), brains in jars, intellect devourers, and a mind flayer maze, which we promptly leave after a drunken Oz tries to maneuver his way through it and a voice tells us to leave.
We at one point stumble across a room that has 6 tablets in it. Upon reading the tablets, we find that each of them represents a spirit and a description of it.

* Nysmund Amar
* Rushieri
* Turcerbelon
* Akimeito
* Rarharikle
* Uire Nuir

One of the tablets has a piece missing from it, which we later find at the Evenbrook tavern. 

At the same time we find the tablet piece, we get some bidniz done:
* Oz started building a bridge (and by building asked Frostmantle, a town carpenter)
* Ideas about starting a trade route with other towns

We killed a fang of Yeenoghu (with the gnolls back at the temple). The gnolls worship a very evil God, Yeenoghu, who likes killing things... this is why all the gnolls had to die. They tried to make nice, tried talking to them, they really did. They didn't listen. So they had to die.

The tablets circle around a soft of iris and the beams of light would open a hole in the floor. We replace the missing piece to find a man dressed in white lying on the ground.

We rouse him to find he cannot talk, but screams with his mind. He actually hurts us in the process of talking.

The man in white kills a grell, and looks horrified by what he is done, so much he casts silence on himself.
