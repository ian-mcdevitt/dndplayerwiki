September 4th, 2015

Timothy Farguard, son of someone in the town guard, was left standing there after the fight. Told us he was threatened into doing so.
We go to the tavern, and exchange information. Praetus tells us about the werewolf. Enna tells them about the pillbug vision. Zari is thought to be a giant pillbug. So the man in white was fighting the moon? Is Peter's purpose to eliminate lycanthropy?
Praetus tells us about his picnic with Telsa, specifically about a clearing, with a stone slab, being painted on by Telsa. A worn path led to the clearing, before Telsa found it. Also about all the werewolf stuff. Every 12-13 days, there were attacks on a man's sheep.
We go to the Daybrooke farm so Oz can talk to sheep. Confirms oddities consistent with a werewolf.
Today is September 4th. Wolf attack happened on September 2nd. Need to 
camp out from the 14th or until we catch the werewolf. Attacks started 3 months ago.
We go to talk to Peter about our ideas about Enna's vision. On our way to him, we are waylaid by a bunch of angry women with men in slings (the men we “fought”) complaining that we hurt them.
Praetus casts zone of truth. John Farguard put them up to it. We go to find John.
Dunkin (town guard) and Guy (refugee guard) are there. Lead us to John's office.
John is upfront, telling us we were an easy scapegoat for all the bad things that were happening in the town. We ask that he make an apology and for his help. He agrees
Oz questions if anything significant happened in the past 3 months. He says the CommonShield brothers (Tristan and Dunkin) joined the guard at that time. Describes them as tardy and energetic. Dad, Lawrence, is a blacksmith.
John says the events are consistent with a Druid. All events happened before dawn. Nature related.
We go home, make some lunch, and Enna presents her vision to Peter. Peter recognizes that Zari is the moon and is a spirit.
Oz medicine checks him, and notices he has no windpipe. Casts cure wounds with no effect. Construct or undead are effected this way?
We go to bed, and observe Zari with our spyglass. We see itty bitty legs moving. ZARI IS A LIVE SPIRIT. This is so cool!
Oz had a vision last night about being in a field of high grass. Swaying grass coming toward him. A tiger with a man face is in front of him. Suddenly all grass flattens. And the vision ends.
