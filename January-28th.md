Afternoon September 14th

Praetus, Oz, and Jim are all down along with Hakour. Keyleth uses smelling salts to rouse Praetus, and he in turn heals Oz and himself. Hakour has his hands and feet frozen, and unconscious.

We suddenly feel slightly more powerful!

We wake up Hakour. He is wild and fearful; we think he was controlled by the dragon. He says we need to be worried about the people of the town. Parinath (the green dragon), came to Hakour seeking help, when he was an injured wyrmling, and raised him. 20 years ago, Parinath snapped, and (possibly) controlled Hakour to try and drive everyone out of town. Every major calamity that befell Evenbrook was his doing. Hakour doesn't know what Parinath's motives are, or the future consequences of Hakour failing. Hakour does know that the dragon's lair was in the swamp between the town and the sunken temple. We tell him that we need to take him back to town.

We fool around with ideas about how Hajour was controlled, but come to no conclusion. Detect magic also doesn't reveal anything odd about Hakour. I send to Tefydarian, asking him if he knows about another insane dragon. He does not know of Parinath, but does know that chromatic dragons have lashed out in recent years. We ask to meet with him, and he agrees, but says he will not be taken advantage of.

We reach the town, and head for the temple, Telsa in tow. We fill the members of the temple in, and ask if anything else happened 20 years ago coinciding with Parinath going insane. Telsa was the only one here 20 years ago, and she just came over then. We find that the Bronzeleaves were the ones that founded Evenbrook, Varik (the father).
