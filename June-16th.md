Morning of September 28th

We wake up in the roper cave.  I send to Jim if everyone in the town is okay. “Yeah. Probably.”

Praetus asks Lathander for guidance about the gnolls, and receives an image of the gnolls in the temple digging through the walls of the temple, which has turned from stone to mud and Lathander says, “They are not safe with you.”

I send to Thor asking if everything is okay at home. “Wouldn't you like to know?” The fuck does that mean?

Bldrlplll informs us that his clothes are tattered and he is missing a breast plate like all the other mindflayers do. I mend his clothes and plan to prestidigitation his robes purple, but we have no solution for the missing breast plate. 

We think about how this mission is potentially suicide, but Bldrlplll is bent on destroying The Elder Brain and rendering the mindflayers useless and “into silence.” We play around with the idea of getting  a brain for the performance eating as a distraction, but we wouldn't know what to get thaat would be impressive or worldly enough to be a good brain. 

New plan courtesy of Praetus! Go into the duargar city and hopefully find someone who is willing to lead a resistance against the mindflayers, eventually get a drow with a brain that's interesting, and then take down The Elder Brain.

We aim for the center of maze to the staircase that spirals down into the city. We come into a wooden building that the bottom of the stairs, with a door leading out. Oz hears a lot of footsteps outside the door, which makes sense because this is the center of the city of Lagurno. Oz steps out, to see where the nearest building we can run to is, and 20ft away from him is a stone keep wall. Super fortified. Right in the center of the keep is a small castle/fortification/tower thing. Roads and buildings, sort of run down a little. We find that the wood down here is made of Barrellstalk fungi, and there's a field of them down here. Oz peeks into a nearby house: lived in, but empty. Oz comes back and fills us in and we absolve to head toward the fungi field where we believe no mindflayers would be. We act like we own the place, and head toward the field.

We walk around the town a little with Bldrlplll to look for negative reactions, and there are definitely a few that seem rebellious, rolling their eyes after Bldrlplll walks past. Oz's dragon informs us that it watched a duargar knock on a door, while watching for rebellious duargar, wait 15 seconds, and then the door opened and let him in. We go to that house and tell Bldrlplll to take a lap. Oz waits invisibly for another to enter and say the password, but he doesn't speak Dwarvish. The password in Common is “Fire of Laduguar,” Laduguar being a sort of duargar God. We speak the password and they open the door. 

There are 8 duargar here, and this is a very normal house, a few chairs around a table. Oz's dragon informs us that he spotted a mindflayer. I relay to Bldrlplll just that and he says that he will head back toward the stairs.

Praetus: “We have come to break the spiral.”
Duargar: “You have come to the right place.”

They go around and say they their names: number-letter. N-22, F-27, G-09, L-10, J-15, A-12, B-21, Z-17. Their names are taken away from them at birth. They ask for arms. We theorize that Bldrlplll could go to vendor and obtain weapons, and tell them about Bldrlplll. N-22 tells us about an increasing number of silenced mindflayers recently. Upon telling them our plan they shoot it down and tell us that it will not work. N-22 suggest setting the field on fire (which has happened before), drawing the mindflayers out of the sept, and enter and attack The Elder Brain. They show us their stache of crude weapons under their floorboards. 12 clubs, 2 short swords, aand 5 picks. We develop a plan, to have the duargar hold the entrance and myself with an AOE, while Oz and Praetus and the remaining just wail on The Elder Brain. But we will need more weapons. And whoever sets the field on fire is basically committing suicide. 

Planning. Much planning.
