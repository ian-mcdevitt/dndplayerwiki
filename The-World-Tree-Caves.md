In an attempt to find out where the creatures that were attacking the town were coming from, we decided to travel three days north of Evenbrook.

We eventually come across what can best be described as a giant upside world tree of underground cavernous systems. At the center is a large hole in the ground, with four rivers entering it, looking like reverse gravitational forces are in play. Jim Darkmagic has been looking at the caves for some time, slowly beginning to build steps into the separate caves. 

The first cave contains chuuls, snakes, and a naga, who was protecting spells, but destroyed a great many things there before we had an opportunity to see anything. Imputess (the naga) says there are many frightening things in these caves.

The second cave down is Tefydarian's lair.

The rest is presently unknown.
