Keyleth wants to go back Titanrock, and plans to return with the next caravan, because it's a long and dangerous journey to go alone.

After fighting the ettins, Oz wants to go and train the guards some more, teaching them how to dodge acid breath. Praetus shows them formations. I go to the temple, and tell Shae and Thor about what just happened. I tell them that the ettins seemed purposeful coming to the town, and knowing what Parinath  making Hakour a possible target, and in turn putting the town in danger. Not entirely sure what to do, we agree to discuss further in the morning after the sermons. Thor says he wants to speak to our group the day after Zari Day. I leave.

Oz makes a talking doorbell.

Sleeeeeeeeep.

Morning of September 16th

Oz's owl comes back  – ettin ran for 3 hours, and make a makeshift bunker for the night.

2AM – We are woken by pounding and shaking of the house. Prateus runs downstairs. Oz goes to Kalt Peter's room, to find the noise is coming from there. He hits to door knob off and enters. KP is just sitting there. Oz touches his shoulder and the shaking stops, and he looks a little confused. He kinda feels like he was having a nightmare, but he's sitting on the floor and not in bed. He was trying to meditate and dozed off, and he doesn't really remember his nightmare, but says it felt more like a memory of him being attacked. Oz probes deeper to try to see his memory. He sees that he was attacked by a large purple dragon, mentally, in a lush green forest. KP is under the impression that this dragon isn't around anymore. Prateus asks him if he knows about Zari. Neutrally tells us stuff we already know. 

We go back to sleep.

We go to the temple and I fill in for Hakour again. Oz is listening to Thor's sermon; Thor is apologetic about the religion ruled government. I speak about Zari since it's Zari Day, and explain the importance of Spirits' impact on our lives, and a little bit about wanting to include the people in the town on decision making. I attract some more followers by talking about Zari and being more in depth than common knowledge. Awesome! Praetus talked about life and not being trapped by a day to day routine and fulfillment.

We draw the temple!

Everyone files out, and the guard is raising the celebratory wall, representing keeping the werewolves out. 

Oz meditates for awhile, and finds that the parts of Oz's lance that contain some of Zari's essence hate the fact that this day is celebrated, since it kinda represents Zari's death. Also it shows him the purple dragon was not destroyed.

I helped out the celebrations some. 

The guards are start setting up a sort of stage, with Thor leading him. Praetus approaches him and Thor asks to see us all. Praetus pries him for more information, and he insinuates that there will be a “change in leadership.”

Oz and Praetus go get Jim to join in on the occasion, Praetus casting Heroism on him, still fully intending to give him a medal. We decide leaving Kalt Peter inside and alone is probably for the best.

We arrive back, and Thor takes the stage, and we see the amount of respect people have for him. He launches into a speech about heroism in the recent events, and calls Jim out. He reiterates that he thought the clergy members were doing a job governing, but it's becoming apparent that this isn't working. He he votes for a mayoral system, and Thor nominates Praetus to be on the ballot based on his merit. There is considerable commotion among the crowd. Praetus takes the stage and welcomes additional votes. 

So far, the ballot includes:
* Praetus
* Oz
* Myself
* John Farguard
* Telsa
* Lawrence Commonshield
* John Frostmantle

There is cheerful deliberation for awhile, about who would make the best mayor. There are various activities: arm wrestling with mage hand, shotput, javelin throwing, gambling, and drinking games.
