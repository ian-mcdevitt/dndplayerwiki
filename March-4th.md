September 19th afternoon

After resting after the chuul fight, Praetus swan dives into the pool to see what's underneath. Some chuul eggs, nothing else. We keep going up the stairs and down a hallway into a tunnel. It kinda corkscrews as we walk. The rock squares off, looking more man-made, like  something of sub-human intellect has carved it out. Carvings start appearing of snakes and snake-like humans, farming. After closer inspection, we can see they are yuan-ti, and that these carvings are pre-nihilism. Yuan-ti are hateful, malicious and territorial... crap. As we continue, the carvings look as if they were scratched off, recently, by something softer than rock, like claws.  

We come to a shaft, with a rotted out ladder. Oz climbs down with the wyrmling. I mend the rotted ladder and Praetus and myself climb down. Several minutes later, we reach the bottom and encounter 3 doors. The right door is scratched, on the left, the carvings are scratched. The middle room is untouched. We open the middle door. It reveals a small hallway, 5'x5'. We open the left door, which contains a small room filled with rotten food. We open the right door. Oz is hit with the worst scent of BO, and the carved room gives way to a natural cavern. We see a large foot in the distance, supine, attached to a large creature. Oz throws a lighted copper piece in that direction. After a closer look, Oz sees it's a troll, sound asleep. Oz quietly slips out, and we proceed down the small hallway, Praetus and I just crouching.

We encounter a door. Hudraer looks under the door, and sees the room beyond contains a crapload of snakes. Oz kicks down the door. 

WHY'D IT HAVE TO BE SNAAAAAAAAAAAKES?!

We just massacred 80 snakes.

This room looks a lot newer than the rest of the area. There is a door on the other side of the room, considerably newer and sturdier looking. We open it and we enter a very large, bright room. Lavish curtains, a raised platform, torches and scratched carvings lining the walls, with ground level holes. We hear a distinct rattle, and a large snake with a human face emerges.  

The naga says his names is Imputress, and he says he knows the cave system very well. We ask for a question for a question. 

* He asks why we don't eat the smaller of us. Praetus replies that Oz is of amusement. 
* Oz asks what caused the cave system.  He says it is the embodiment of a World Tree. 
* He says this land has been long devoid of humans and asks how we got here. We say by boat, from the continent of Archellia. 
* We ask him what he's guarding. He says a trove of spells.
* He asks why we are here. We tell him [I FORGET WHAT YOU TOLD HIM].
* We ask if there's anything else of worry in the cave system. He in turns asks me what is there NOT to be afraid of. 

He says he is done with us. "Childern, FEAST."

NO REALLY WHY SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKES?!

The naga barely escapes.
