Evening of September 26th

The statues fall apart, showing that they are hollow. On the inside of the neck is something written in Qualith. The rooms move again. A new passage appears. Oz is casting comprehend languages, and as he does so, the room moves again, and continues to do so. “Rise, fiend of stone, and defend your master” reads the inscription. Mind flayers serve an elder brain. We go down a well worn hallway. It comes to a T. To the right comes a horrible smell. The left is more well worn. We go right, after adding some pleasant smells via prestidigitation. We find the smell is coming from crates in what resembles a store room. There's some jars with gooey icky sticky stuff whose smell almost knocks Oz on his ass. He determines it to be rotting brain matter. The crates are also filled with varying sizes of brain, from halfling to much smaller creatures. Praetus looks for secret doors and finds one. We hear, with Oz's comprehend languages, someone saying “BRIGHT. SMASH.” before the light goes out down the secret passage. We crawl between the shelves and go through.

Down there it comes to a hallway proper, with an iron door to the left, and a line on the floor indicating that this is where it would start rotating, before the door, and to the right it curves. Oz tries to open the door quietly and fails. We hear glorping. We enter the room, lavishly furnished. A cloaked figure runs to the right. I immediately run after, with Oz and Praetus in tow. Suddenly, the floor gives way to spikes, and I jump over. Oz tries to be cool and let Praetus swing across, but sucks and loses his grip. Praetus falls in the pit, but is okay. I enter the room, with Oz crawling on the ceiling, and throw open a curtain. Behind it is a cowering mind flayer. Oz can understand him, and he's muttering to himself that we're going to kill him. After speaking to him, he cries out that he wants us to save him from the silence. He was cast out from his coven. His name is Bldrlplll. He says he was cast out for eating rat brains and he wants us to kill his coven back in Unterholm for revenge. We decide to stay the night here in his chamber and go to Unterholm in the morning. 

Morning of September 27th

Praatus prays to the sun that we cannot see. We ask Bldrlplll about Luan Phien and he kicks aside his bed to reveal a funerary slab. It marks the duargar prince Luan Phien, lover of clockwork, but the slab does not say if he is buried here. Oz lifts the lid, and it's filled with coinage, on top of a mummy, which comes alive.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We didn't even finish the fight. They just gave up. We killed the mummy and the zombies just fell.

We loot the coffin.
