Afternoon of October 12th

As we rest in the hut, we hear the same voice that spoke to us before: “Your courage will fail you.” There's a walkway around most of the room, with a platform in the center, and water everywhere else. Everything is dark, slimy, and littered with bones. There are no exists in this room. We leave the way we came in.

We go back into the larger room, and enter another tunnel with no gate over it that we missed before. As we enter the next room, the water is 3 ft deep. There are natural stone ledges and islands all around. The opposite side of the room has another tunnel submerged under water. There is an empty nest also here, made of rock and bones. We think it might be a giant octopus nest. We go through the other tunnel. Heavy rain is battering in this room. Destroyed vessels and dead humans are visible through the rain. We swim about 30 ft before the destroyed ships. The ships look to be about 400 years old, the rot rotted and mostly unusable. There is sand at the bottom, and the ships are touching the floor. There is something large quickly darting from ship to ship. I warn Oz, who is climbing on the walls above, that we think we found the octopus. There is a powerful current heading toward the east and west sides of the room. 

Suddenly... Hydra!

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

It got up to nine heads, but Praetus completely laid into it. We're fine.

We notice some shiny things under where the ships are. We also get a better look at the ships. Two are merchant galleys and 2 are pirate ships complete with cannons. Praetus goes to the captains cabin on one of the pirates ship and finds a skeleton with great scale maile armor on. I go to the bottom and follow a trail of coins to a chest, with 1000 coins, a fist sized diamond, two rubies, numerous smaller gems, and jug plugged with numerous corks (Alchemy jug), a jewel encrusted scabbard, and a simitar. Oz heads to a merchant ship. While exploring some of the room, Praetus finds a week old corpse, Valerian looking, leaning against a stalagmite. 

As we're resting and identifying things, we hear again, “You are weak. Give into your fear.”

We go down one of the areas with the strong current. We encounter a 20ft wide whirlpool. We let ourselves get swept into it and go down.

We fall and fall and fall through water, then fall up, through the air, and back into the water. We realize we're back in the prison room. We feel like magic played a part in that. Instead of going straight back, we decide to go back to the drum room where we know we left an unexplored area. Oz hears again, “You are already dead.” We keep going until we reach a junction with three ways to go. 2 underwater, 1 above. To the northeast we see a frosty cave, with a bare chested man, with prancing ice meefits around him, with eladrin black with frostbite, being held prisoner. We fly in, fuck these assholes.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Killed them pretty easily.

Oz hears, “They're coming for you.” K, boss.

The eladrin stuck to the wall. 3 of them are dead. The rest are missing limbs. We plan to chisel them out and get the boat to save them. We put them in the drum room and set the drum on fire to warm them up.  We go back into the room we just from, and enter another tunnel which leads into a throne room. The water radiated divination magic. A narwhal horn rests on the arms of the throne. Praetus picks up the horn, and the horn kind of pulls him toward the water. 

The water becomes perfect still, and becomes a scrying screen. Through the water looms a large building with columns. We see a saw toothed maul, and 8 fishy humanoids worshiping a tentacle-y sharp mouthed... creature. The head of the creature looks like the head of what we saw pop up in the swamp earlier. The fishy humanoids are kuo-toa. 

Praetus takes the narwhal horn, after I identify that it is used for scrying. We notice water drifting toward one end of the room and we find a hidden door. We go through. We find ourselves in the giant octopus room. Good thing Praetus is keeping track of all of this. 

We hear some noise in the room, and see 2 giant octopi.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We go back into the shipwreck room and down the other whirlpool. We're in a new room with nets dividing the room on stalagmites. On the far side of the room are double doors under the water. On the nets are four Slads, aliens from the Chaotic Limbo that lay eggs in live humanoids. We decide to attack them before they get to us, and we need to get to those impressive doors on the other side of the room.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT (with surprise round)

We beat them, but I have a baby alien in me, which Praetus quickly gets rid of.

I hear, “Death is close. You will die.” The messages are getting more frequently and they're getting more explicit. Then Oz hears, “Kill them all before they kill you.”

Something compels me to go a different way from Praetus and Oz, and after a second of them being confused, Praetus slaps me to my senses. I then hear, “They have turned against you. Now take your revenge.”

We go through the double doors. We see the building that we saw in the scrying water. With the fish people worshiping the statue. They see us.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We fight them, and fight the wave after them.
