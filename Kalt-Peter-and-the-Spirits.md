In the swamps outside of Evenbrook, in the middle of a lake, we found a temple. Amongst the gnolls and the other monstrosities that lived there, we found 6 stone tablets, one of them broken. They each represented a different Spirit.

* Nysmund Amar
* Rushieri
* Turcerbelon
* Akimeito
* Rarharikle
* Uire Nuir

We later found the missing piece of tablet, and inserted it. An iris opened in the floor, and there we found Kalt Peter.

We find that Kalt Peter cannot speak. Every time he attempts to do so, he screams with his mind, hurting everyone around him. He writes in a language that Oz has deceiphered. He spends a lot of time to himself in room, seldomly talking to us. 

We have found that he spends more of his time "researching" according to him. There are copious notebooks and papers scattered around is room, written out spells, and other arcane information. We found pieces of grells in his closet. He also states the grells are "from home" and that brains in jars and mind eaters are "great pets" and "tasty."

Oz found out that KP believes in multiple planes, it is theoretically possible to cross them, and that he is not from the Shadowfell, through his notes.

At one point, something happens in the town, some sort of interdemensional phenomena happens and Mouthers appear, killing two of the towns people before we can eliminate them. Although Telsa of the clergy brought the one back from the dead, he seems too traumatized from the experience to share any information with us. Even the day after, the buildings appear warped and the place reeks of magic. We bring Peter there, to see his reaction and gets his input. He seems unimpressed and not surprised, but he *fixes* it. He states "it was torn."

Acheuadi talks to Enna for the first time concerning Kalt Peter the same day:

*“He who calls himself Kalt Peter – he was known by another name: The White Scourge – was one of the interlopers. He, Acruum Investi, and Maggot; the Three Dreaded Ones. It was only halfway through the war their influence was known.”*

Kalt Peter also rages at the names of the Spirits, further enforcing that something between Peter and the Spirits is amiss.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We eventually come to find that Acheaudi is Kalt Peter's mother, and that he is a spirit called Ushay Touadi. Ushay is the spirit of the great dimensional barrier, the product of 100+ spirits. He was both the shield and the sword. Kalt Peter brought about the end of the world as we knew it, 440 years ago, destroyed Ushay and the barrier between this world and others. 

Ushay feels like everything deserves protection, and that protecting others is his only purpose, so Acheaudi makes him to once he once was.

Ushay becomes Enna's new patron, since her views on the world anf people have diverged with Acheaudi's since arriving to Evenbrook, and says he will help protect the town.
