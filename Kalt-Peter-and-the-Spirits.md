After a child and one of the refugees went missing near a river in Evenbrook, we followed tracks to some sort of temple centered in the middle of a lake.
There we found gnolls, and the two missing people chained up waiting to be sacrificed. We return to the town with the child and the refugee unharmed, but we do decide to go back and set some ground rules with the gnolls to leave the people of Evanbrook alone.
We find out that gnolls are just inherently evil creatures that worship the very evil God Yeenoghu, and they refuse to reason with us. We end up killing a majority of them, leaving the young unharmed.
The temple is huge with winding passageways. We enter dark rooms with mind eaters and brains in jars, and at one part even stumble upon a huge maze with way more powerful things than we realize we can handle. We'll have to go back and explore this area when we are more experienced.
There are also flumphs, which are the most adorable things we've ever seen. With flat bodies and tentacles, they change color depending on their moods. They love Enna's telepathy, and we found that they feed off of telepathic thoughts. In one of the cavernous areas of the temple, we found a gigantic dark flumph. We think it went mad from feeding off of bad thoughts for so long. 

In another section of the temple, we found 6 stone tablets, one of them broken. They each represented a different Spirit.

* Nysmund Amar
* Rushieri
* Turcerbelon
* Akimeito
* Rarharikle
* Uire Nuir

We later found the missing piece of tablet, and inserted it. An iris opened in the floor, and there we found Kalt Peter.

We find that Kalt Peter cannot speak. Every time he attempts to do so, he screams with his mind, hurting everyone around him. He writes in a language that Oz has deceiphered. He spends a lot of time to himself in room, seldomly talking to us. 

We have found that he spends more of his time "researching" according to him. There are copious notebooks and papers scattered around is room, written out spells, and other arcane information. We found pieces of grells in his closet. He also states the grells are "from home" and that brains in jars and mind eaters are "great pets" and "tasty."

Oz found out that KP believes in multiple planes, it is theoretically possible to cross them, and that he is not from the Shadowfell, through his notes.

At one point, something happens in the town, some sort of interdemensional phenomena happens and Mouthers appear, killing two of the towns people before we can eliminate them. Although Telsa of the clergy brought the one back from the dead, he seems too traumatized from the experience to share any information with us. Even the day after, the buildings appear warped and the place reeks of magic. We bring Peter there, to see his reaction and gets his input. He seems unimpressed and not surprised, but he *fixes* it. He states "it was torn."

Acheuadi talks to Enna for the first time concerning Kalt Peter the same day:

*“He who calls himself Kalt Peter – he was known by another name: The White Scourge – was one of the interlopers. He, Acruum Investi, and Maggot; the Three Dreaded Ones. It was only halfway through the war their influence was known.”*

Kalt Peter also rages at the names of the Spirits, further enforcing that something between Peter and the Spirits is amiss.
