We found Kalt Peter "locked" in a temple, with the implication that the Spirits had put him there.

He is a white human of average height with no hair and blue eyes. He dresses in white robes.

Oh, and he screams. With his mind. Every time he attempts to speak, he causes harm to everything and eveyone around him.

Cure wounds doesn't affect him, nor does does he have a pulse or a trachea.

He writes in a language that one one can recognize, but Oz Greenbottle has deciephered most of his foreign alphabet, so we communicate with him through that way.

He has a room with us in our newly built him, and spends a lot of time to himself.

After much floudering and confusion, from finding bits and pieces of Underdark creatures in his closet to fixing patches of warped reality in the town, we meet with Acheaudi in the temple.

Kalt Peter's real name is Ushay Touadi. Kalt Peter is the mortal body he is in. Ushay is the spirit of the great dimensional barrier, the product of 100+ spirits, but mostly her. He was both the shield and the sword. Kalt Peter brought about the end of the world as we knew it, 440 years ago, destroyed Ushay and the barrier between this world and others.

He says his soul purpose in this world is to protect. Acheaudi helps him reveal his nature form, and he eventually finds his path and pulls himself toegther.

He then becomes Enna's patron.
