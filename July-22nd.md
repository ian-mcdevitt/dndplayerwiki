Evening? Of September 28th

We're in a very green clearing, with that large tree off in the distance, about three miles. There is another circle of mushroom around us, presumably a fey circle on this side too. Bubbles looks around, completely confused, and leaves through the portal again, saying he doesn't belong here. We follow him, just to talk to him a moment longer. Oz asks him what he makes of the portal being here, and the Elder Brain being dead. Bubbles says it was a back door, and it would have been very easy to infiltrate and kill the Elder Brain. We still don't know WHAT replaced the Elder Brain in terms of controlling the mindflayers. Bubbles can only guess that it was something similar controlling them. 

We decide to spend the night here, where we are familiar and there's no more threat. Bubbles is going to ceremoniously remove the mindflayers brains, and doesn't want help. He carry some of the duergar bodies out back toward the city. We find the duergar have set the stone keep on fire in celebration of their lifted oppression. I send to Jim briefly about our encounter. “Well, that differs from the encounters I've heard.” What?

We go to sleep in Leomond's tiny hut courtesy of Oz. 

Morning of September 29th

Bubbles is laying 5 of the wisest mindflayers to rest. Oz asks him what he will do now. He says his revenge was fulfilled and that the wisest would want him to rebuild but he will not. He is upset that all the knowledge is gone. He is unsure. We say we'll check back with him.

We're going to go through the portal. It is the same time of day as last night. It looked like something large cut through this area, but the trail becomes indiscernible after awhile. As soon as we enter the tree line, it becomes dark, hot and humid. Oz flies up to make sure we can find our way up later. Same sea of tree canopies, with no clearing in sight. Oz doesn't disbelief any illusions. We walk back into the clearing, but after 5 minutes, we never come across it. Back forward. After an hour, we see what might be a clearing. 

On the far end of the clearing, the knee high grass is depressed, past a T shape of also depressed grass. Praetus heads over to it, and disappears from view. There is a ring of mushrooms around it. This is the same clearing. The hell? We head east and make marks in the trees, and turn around 500ft later to see if we could make it back. The marks are now on the right of us, instead of behind us. Oz flies above and tries to fly toward the tree, but doesn't... seem to... move... anywhere.

We go into the treeline with no destination in mind, and go forward. We end up in a clearing... but a different one, there are different kinds of mushrooms. The mushrooms are not magical, but there is magic in the air. We hear giggling through the tree line, like it's moving. The giggling stops after Oz tries to investigate. We hear a crash to the east approaching us. A man is running full tilt toward us, his staff getting caught between two trees and he falls gracelessly. His eyes darting and his voice frenzied, he says he has found the mortals. Praetus approaches and he gives a creepy smile. 

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

After fighting pixies trying to take our weapons, and twig blights gnawing at our ankles, and the eledrin elf shape shifting into a giant ape, he finally yields. He screams, rubbing his head, saying the voice in his head, the voice of nature, told him to attack us. He tells us he knows about the temple and the mindflayers. When questioned, he becomes increasingly agitated about how when the voice tells him to do things, he must do it. He must kill us.

Praetus uses Apparro who is a spirit of nature to calm him down, and the voice goes away, and he's slightly more rational. He says he sees the temple, the swamp, gnolls. He was told all of this two days ago, when we woke up with Bubbles and fight the quaggoths. Oz tells the elf to meditate and he will try and listen in. After a while, he is calm enough to do so. 

Oz says the elf failed and that no one is safe while we are alive, calling us the destroyers, said we associated with gnolls and ilithids, which are obviously half truths. Oz is able to discern that this isn't an otherworldly voice. It's just a creature. I send to Hakour, asking if he can come to us in the feywilde now. “My capabilities are none of your concern.” I immediately send to Jim asking what he's heard about our situation and where Hakour is. Jim says Hakour is saying that we're bringing an army back with us and that everyone needs to leave town.

Hakour and this elf are hearing the same things...

Also, the elf says the giant tree is not the World tree. It's a place called Tree Haven, eledrin living there.

Oz sends his owl with the Unnamed Druid, to help him cope. He also says when we come back, he will not be here; he's going to try and escape the voice.

We go back through the portal and make our way into the plaza where we fought everything. We pry open some of the openings where the mindflayers reside (to see if there were any scrolls to get us back home quickly) and collect some gemstones, potions and a bag of holding. 

Oz finds Bubbles and they touch minds, to see if what Bubbles sensed in place of the Elder Brain is the same that was talking to the elf. It is.

We stop in the roper cave to rest, and then we're going to B line back home.

Morning of September 30th

Gogogo. Through the maze and halfway up the tunnel. As we're making camp, we feel rumbling. But nothing transpires.

Morning of October 1st

We make it up through the rest of the hallway and up to the flumphs. Sleep on the beds the flumphs made for us that one time. I send to Jim for an update of the town. He says he left 2 days ago, but he heard people were contemplating leaving. I send to John Farguard asking him what's up and not to believe Hakour. John tells us that Hakour is a trusted leader and that he saw us being friendly with enemies. Fucking idiots. I send to Guy on Oz's behalf, telling him not to believe anything flying around town and to gather the refugees and staying in town.

Morning of October 2nd

We wake up in the flumph chamber, ready to head out. We should make it home by the end of today.
