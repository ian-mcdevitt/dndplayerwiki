After a child and one of the refugees went missing near a river in Evenbrook, we followed tracks to some sort of temple centered in the middle of a lake.

There we found gnolls, and the two missing people chained up waiting to be sacrificed. We return to the town with the child and the refugee unharmed, but we do decide to go back and set some ground rules with the gnolls to leave the people of Evanbrook alone.

We find out that gnolls are just inherently evil creatures that worship the very evil God Yeenoghu, and they refuse to reason with us. We end up killing a majority of them, leaving the young unharmed.

The temple is huge with winding passageways. We enter dark rooms with mind eaters and brains in jars, and at one part even stumble upon a huge maze with way more powerful things than we realize we can handle. We'll have to go back and explore this area when we are more experienced.

There are also flumphs, which are the most adorable things we've ever seen. With flat bodies and tentacles, they change color depending on their moods. They love Enna's telepathy, and we found that they feed off of telepathic thoughts. In one of the cavernous areas of the temple, we found a gigantic dark flumph. We think it went mad from feeding off of bad thoughts for so long. 

Inside the temple, we found the six Spirit tablets and subsequently Kalt Peter.
