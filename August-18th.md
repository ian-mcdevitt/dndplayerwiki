Evening of October 6th

The compass is a compass that points to where we want to go. Useful? We're still near the top of the tree. We go out the room and down the ramp to the doorway we passed halfway up. The room is entirely covered in webs. There are torches on the walls, lit, but the web is not igniting. Nothing on the ceilings this time. The web kind of acts a trampoline, springy, but not slimy (except the walls) or sticky.  After slicing some of the web, a wooden floor lies underneath, and the wall can be seen past the webs if you're really looking. There is another door on the opposite side of the room. Magical fire appears to get through it, but not normal fire or a blade. Through the door we go. 

Past a smallish antichamber is a gap, then a higher ledge. Oz's dragon sees a platform halfway up on the gap. As Oz lands on it, it shakes and begins to fall slowly. Praetus climbs down and explores the area. He hears chirping. It sounds like a minor spirit, coming from the top ledge. Oz flys up, and we ride the platform up. In a chest, is a tiny little ball of flame, chirping. I cast tongues to speak with it. She says her name is Etna, and she is supposed to warm the roots, but the flying scorpions put her here, and that there is a bigger one to worry about. To the roots!

Back to the center of the tree, and down the giant hole in the middle of the main room. Burn away the webs. Down the vines we go. Down below is a small body of water, with solid ground some feet away. Walk on water! Wall, ceiling, floor, webs, like the other rooms. We burn some more webs and reveal another door. We find ourselves in a giant cavern. On the ceiling are multiple egg sacs, and we hear scurrying at the ceiling. In further, there is a giant root. A giant flying scorpion lands on top of Etna.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

So she was resistant to everything with she wasn't on her back. And babies kept falling from the sky. Oz pounds it with his monkey fists, and Hakour sets it on fire. Brutal.

Etna sits in a depression in the floor, and it fills with liquid fire, and she proclaims that she's done. The rots turn from an ashen color to more brown.  

We climb up the vines and out of the tree. Pinegrove wakes up, says he's felt better, but he's awake. Pinegrove's got jokes, making fun of Praetus's last name. We ask him where the Living Gate is. He says he hasn't heard anyone mention the Living Gate or Utereshk in many years. He says he'll give us an envoy to lead us there. He says the Living Gate is his brother. He gave his life and his agency to protect... sounds like Ushay. We ask about Utereshk and explain that someone is trying to summon it. He says his brother gave all his power to seal her away, and the Living Gate has stood for 10,000 years.  He's confident it will stand. 

Rest time. I make a pact with Naberius. 

Hakour leaves us, saying he must look after Evenbrook, and has faith that we can accomplish what must be done.
