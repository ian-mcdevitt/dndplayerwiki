We found Kalt Peter "locked" in a temple, with the implication that the Spirits had put him there.

He is a white human of average height with no hair and blue eyes. He dresses in white robes.

Oh, and he screams. With his mind. Every time he attempts to speak, he causes harm to everything and eveyone around him.

Cure wounds doesn't affect him, nor does does he have a pulse or a trachea.

He writes in a language that one one can recognize, but Oz Greenbottle has deciephered most of his foreign alphabet, so we communicate with him through that way.

He has a room with us in our newly built him, and spends a lot of time to himself.
