A mindflayer exiled from his coven for being different, he lived awhile in a seculed, labirynth type prison, until we found him. In our quest to erradicate the mindflayers, he agreed to help, to make them hear the "silence" he has heard for so long, the "silence" being his severed mind connection with the Elder Brain. 

Courageous and loyal, he helped us to the death, and luckily, Hakour was able to bring him back from the dead.

Now that everything is gone, Bldrlplll is unsure of what to do. He admitted that the elders in the coven would want him to rebuild, but he doesn't intend to fulfill that.
