After distrusting Hakour for some time through his various actions (charming me, not being present during attacks on the town, etc) and finally hearing his name from the treeants as being the one to recruit them to attack the town and drive the people of Evenbrook out, we decide it's now time to take action.

While Keyleth follows him one afternoon, she finds that Hakour has been threatening dryads with a dragon. We call a meeting and intend to trap Hakour there with the rest of the clergy. He escapes and we fight through his lair to find him with a green dragon, Parinath. Parinath sais Hakour has screwed up and that the town and he will suffer for it. We bring Hakour down, and upon awaking from unconciousness, is broken and terrified at what he has done. Hakour knew Parinath as a wyrmling and raised him, but about 20 years, Parinath snapped and Hakour is been fufilling his wishes to drive the people of Evenbrook out of town, but we still do not full understand why. We question if he was fully aware of his actions, and bring him back into town. He will remain in a jail cell in the temple until we can reach a verdict on what should be done with him.

The next morning, we make the town's people aware during the clergy's surmons, and decide to divulge everything on Zari Day, the day after.

I sent to Tefydarian if he knows anything about the crazed dragon Parinath, and he confesses that he does not know of Parinath, but does know that in recent years, there has been an insanity associated with the chromatic dragons. We ask to see him to talk about this more, and he begrudgingly agrees.

We found out through some investigatin' that Hakour thought he was hearing "the voice of nature" and that was controlling his actions. We also met an elf in the Fey Wild that acted similarly to Hakour, claiming that the voice of Nature told him to kill us. 

Also, probably related, there was a portal to the Fey Wild behind a very dead Elder Brain...

While we were dealing with the mindflayer threat deep under the temple in the swamp, Hakour scried for us and presumed that we were up to no good. He notified the town and told them to evacuate as he thought we were coming back with an army to attack Evenbrook.

Praetus's spirit companion, Apa'ro, helped Hakour find his way, and we confronted each other about what he scried and what Jim told us Hakour was doing.

Hakour has agreed to aid us in stopping this unknown force that looms over Evenbrook, threatening to destroy the town and it's people.
