Afternoon September 14th

The thing that Keyleth memorized from the dryad encounter with Hakour: “...dare threaten us with a dragon, let alone...”

We run to the next door, before my hypnotic pattern runs out. Suddenly, there's no stone floor. It's like an underground forest in here. In the center of the room, there is a large tree, and there are 3 doors on all opposite walls. The door behind us slams shut, and we hear animal noises, insects to one side, wolves to another, and birds to the last. Oz climbs the tree, and knocks down a glowing globe thing. It shatters. We go toward the bird noises.

It narrows, and the fog suddenly stops. There is a stake with a cow's skull on it, We break it, throw shit at walls, at the floor, look around everywhere in the immediate area. Nothing. We go back to the insect noises, and the room rearranged itself... Even tying rope and trying to figure out if it's the fog or the hallway... Nothing. We go toward the insects. Same effect. Now there is a sign, written in cow's blood that reads, “Turn back.” Oz moonwalks back into the main door. I detect magic, and the three others go toward wolf. It reveals a similar room, but *I* am not there. There are various... nature... smells? After moving slightly to any direction, we differentiate spring, winter, and autumn smells. We move toward winter.

Immediately after the fog ends, there is a pit of stakes. We go down to spring (after the room completely resets, so we have to go down wolf again). We face a stake pointing directly at us after the fog ends. Praetus takes it. Autumn it is. New similar room! Grass gets thinner, thicker, and same growth in different directions. We go toward thinning grass, thinking thinning dying grass is associated with autumn. We are facing a door.

We enter a room, with tree sap stinking up the place and coating the walls. There is a door on the opposite wall. As we advance, powerful winds threaten to push us in the sap, and suddenly there are giant bugs to fight.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We kill the stirges, fight wind, and destroy the hive.

We enter the next room, it's the same rooms as before, but now it's snowing. There are four snow covered things breathing in the snow. Wolves. Praetus activates a trip wire that catches him and Keyleth in a net suspended above the ground.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
**highlight – Praetus grapples a wolf.

Praetus and Oz took some major damage, but one of the wolves got away, so we know we need to keep moving.

We enter the next room, where Hakour sits. A green dragon is beside him, saying he screwed up and to deal with us. The dragon jumps in the river and swims away. Hakour sits there, with a pile of wolves behind him. He transforms into an earth elemental and makes the river dividing us and him into a wall.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT
**highlight – Jim explodes all the wolves. Water weird tries to drown Praetus and Oz. Praetus grapples a PILE OF ROCKS. Oz bleeds out and then doesn't. Praetus goes down. Keyleth learns the power of spell slots. Keyleth freezes Hakour once he drops into the water after dropping his earth elemental form.

Hakour goes down.
