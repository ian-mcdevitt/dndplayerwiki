Ushay is the spirit of the great dimensional barrier. He is both the shield and the sword. 

He is the product of 100+ spirits, but mostly Acheaudi. Kalt Peter brought about the end of the world as we knew it, 440 years ago, destroyed Ushay and the barrier between this world and others.

Acheaudi helps him reveal his true self, and he says his one soul purpose is to protect. He eventually becomes Enna's patron.
