We go to the morning sermon. Oz and Praetus try to question Telsa, who quickly shuts them down, saying she is too busy.
Praetus tries to buy a scroll of sending, and tries to buy the scroll from the farmer's son. He gives it to him to give to Telsa, for her to call us if she happens to run into trouble.
Enna and Praetus go to investigate Duncan Commonshield, who describes issues that started three months ago. He confirmed with a few stories of druid consistent incidences.
Oz goes to the Magnus Daybrooke's farm, and asks Magnus how he can help. He helps a cow give birth, and names is ToughBottom.
We meet up, and decide to travel north to see what Hakour is up to, at Telsa's advisory. Detect object says Hakour is not in town, so we travel north.
We suddenly hear a scream, and run to the south, toward town again. We see Gibbering Mouthers, trying to devour townsfolk. One Firemaw and one dwarf dies in battle. The four Mouthers died to us.
