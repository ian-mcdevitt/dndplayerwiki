Evening of September 25th

Oz is chopping down trees to use as a barricade at the entrance of the temple. KP has nothing useful to use for a barricade magically. I talk to the gnolls about what we're up against. The Pack Lords keep increasing with every attack, and are expecting 4 this time. And then they come with a Fang above them. The Fang is a monster of demonic power (possibly possessed).

We arm the 10 largest knolls with leftover weapons around the temple, preparing a fight tonight. We also make a trip wires with pitons and rope. We think about other traps we could make and think that it would be awesome to have oil. We find the torches lining the walls have reservoirs of oils behind them. We have some and use them to make four Molotov to throw over the barricade when they trip over the wires.   
 
We go to sleep, and take turns watching.

At midnight, Oz's owl informs him that humanoid creatures are approaching in boats. 10 in 2 boats. Gnolls. Upon flying up while invisible, Oz discovers another boat coming from the opposite direction. One of the boats as a giant ass shadow thing coming toward. 23 total. 

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We win. Barely. All the gnolls remained alive.
