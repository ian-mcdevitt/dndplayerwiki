**Background:** I have received messages and visions from a Spirit called Acheuadi.  Every time I look into my shard of glass, or out into the open water at sunset, I wait for answers to questions I don't even know yet. I look for visions in the water, whether they be past, present, or future. They are always in pieces, and almost never make complete sense, but always lead me to something else of greater meaning. Along with these visions, I haave also gained incredible power.

Wandering Archelia as a Sage, I have learned of a great War between the Gods and the Spirits. I know little of it, but I do know that the Gods won, and I want to know the cause and the reprecussions of it all. I have come across Tephra and Elend in these travels, two of the five Enforcers, who used the Utopian Engines to stop the Valerian War.The Utopian engines were pieces of Kiedre, who was a half spirit. This has been my first concrete proof of the Spirits being the cause of something so great.

After meeting Acheadui, in the flesh (as much as you can a Spirit, I found that I had changed incredibly as a person, and that I am caring for people who I don't even know very well. I learning to protect people as a whole, which is something Acheaudi cannot relate to. Realizing my change, I have gone to Ushay Touadi, the protector, after finding himself and his purpose again, and now he is my patron.

**Goal:** My former goal was to be the cause of Acheuadi's resurgance into the world. I want people to believe in the Spirits again, to recognize them as something equivalent to the Gods. The spirits may not provide tangible connections and instant gratification, because they work in mysterious ways. It's hard believing in something that no one else believe in, to be criticized and to be called crazy. Now that I have found Ushay, I do not want this any less, but I will do this while also helping those around me who need it, with someone that shares my purpose, and that is Ushay.
