It's the morning of Sept. 6th

We wake up at home, and the silence and deafening.

We find KP in his room, bandaging a wounded arm. Praetus lays on hands. KP points to the closet, which contains grell parts (beaks, tentacles, and brain). We ask (write what Oz knows letter wise) him where they came from. Looks like there was a struggle room.

“Are these not common?” KP asks. 
“No.”
“Where are they from?”
“Home?”
“What plane?”
“I don't know.”

Enna looks around. Copies notebooks litter the floor. Complicated arcane symbols and some sort of hand motion arcaney-thing catches her interest. She asks KP if she can look at it later. He shrugs. Oz bags the grell parts (we determine. They all rush to Praetus's morning sermon.

Oz gives Adrian (Praetus' cleric) 5 gold to give to the leader of Titanrock with the caravan, which is departing today.

Oz is checking to see is Jim is home. Nope. Oz plops the grell insides in front of them and ask if they are aware of what happened. They are ignorant. They kinda sorta recognize it's a grell from Jim's book. Oz tells them about last night and this morning is KP's room. Oz sits in the corner looking at the book.
Prietro Daybrooke and Thomas Riverbeard (the scribes) do an identify ritual.

Enna goes back to KP to see if he will let me read his arcane books. His door is open, scrawling on his desk. He allows me to look at his book. Looks like an invocation, cone of cold, but I don't know how to read spells. He's probably a wizard? I ask him if he can cast it. He nods. He's been doing this since he's gotten here. Writes “research.” I go to find Oz at Jim's. 

Praetus is going to Rodick's (saved dragonborne from last name) place and checking on the Parish. Roderick is beside himself, disoriented. Wife Miranda lets him in. She tells him she's never seen him like this. He holds a liquor bottle that he doesn't drink from. Praetus asks him to look after the Daybrooke farm, to keep his mind off of what just happened. He agrees.

Prateus and Enna arrive while the ritual is happening at Jim's. Tom says grells shouldn't exist, stories saying they're ficticious, originating from Pre-Nihilism. Mouthers are also in the book. They are described as failed conjurations. We take the scribes to where the fight happened last night (warped buildings and such). They cast detect magic. Loooooooootta magic. Everything was done right, totally intentional.

We go back home to see if we can get KP to weigh in on the area. He agrees to come. He sees the warped buildings. He's not too impressed, but investigates the scene. He sits in the center, and slowly everything unwarps.

“What did you do?” I telepathy.
“I fixed it.”
“Fixed WHAT?”
“It was torn.”

The scribes say there is no more magic here.

Peter's GOTTA be the lodestone...

“Stretched too far. It would have collapsed.”
“Who would have done this?”
“Nobody did this. It just happened.”
“This is never happened before.”
“This happens all the time.”

“Find the source.” he tells us.

We tell him about the brain puppies.
“Great pets.” he replies, nodding enthusiastically. “Tasty too.”

“....HEH?”

Enna also recalls to KP where we found him and the spirit tablets. He asks what spirits are. As she starts naming the spirits, he rages and knocks them all on their asses. He runs away.

Oz and Praetus run after him. He rope tricks into his closet. Oz and Praetus explore the room and read his copious notebooks.

Enna goes down to the water, and sits on a dock and thinks.

**************************
She know there was a war between the Gods and the Spirits, brought about by a third party (of apparently 2-5 people) with the intention of the Gods winning the war and ridding the world of the Spirits. The instigators disappeared. During the Valerian War, the Utopian Engines were obtained by the Enforcers, and they stopped the war. The Utopian engines were pieces of Kiedre, who was a half spirit. She has learned this from talking to Tephra and Elend on her travels as a sage, looking for more information about the spirits.

Enna realizes she is a false prophet. Spirits are dismissed because there is no gratification and reward from worshiping them, but there is a result when you pray to Gods. She's angry and unsure of everything happening right now, and feels like KP is a sort of enemy. At the same time, she feels like she needs to connect with him, to find out more about the Spirits.
*****************************

Oz found out that KP believes in multiple planes, it is theoretically possible to cross them, and that he is not from the Shadowfell, through his notes.

KP eventually shows himself again and locks himself in his room, despite Prateus and Oz trying to communicate with him.

They go back to the scribes, and ask them if they know anything about multiple realities. They are excited and search through their many books, but hey can't find them.

The scribes found that the pages containing that information are magic'd to be invisible. Tom the scribe goes into detail about the contents, the nesting plane theory, intersecting plane theory, and the directed graph planes theory, the three main theories concerning planes.

Oz tries to relay this information to KP.
He sends a note back out. “Where did you find this?”
“Research.” Jackass.

Acheuadi sends Enna a message at sunset at the docks. This is the first time she's hearing her. She sounds like grating glass, but simultaneously beautiful:

“He who calls himself Kalt Peter – he was known by another name: The White Scourge – was one of the interlopers. He, Acruum Investi, and Maggot; the Three Dreaded Ones. It was only halfway through the war their influence was known.”

Oh.
	Oh.
		Okay. Hold up.

From what Enna knows from talking to Tephra and Elend, they fought the Maggot man. This now makes sense. If Maggot man is one of the interlopers, they were trying to fight off the spirits again, because the Enforcers had the spirit Utopian Engines. Kalt Peter is now another one names. But who is this Acruum Investi. What can Enna do with this information. She knows that KP is a huge threat now, but she can't let him know. Should she tell the others? How? They're not likely to believe her, anyway, she thinks.

She heads home, through town, after sunset, still contemplating everything. Up north, she sees something dark and undulating in the sky, huge in size. She runs home and tells Oz and Praetus to come outside and see. Praetus sees wings and it's brown. Oz tries to talk to the birds to scout it out. 

It's a dragon...
Oh. Copper dragon. That's better.

They alert the towns guard. Oz is trying to drum the dragon away from the town toward him. Enna goes to ring the temple bell. Praetus is knocking on doors delegating for a possible evacuation plan.

Oz thunder waves multiple times. The dragon doesn't care and keeps going.

Oz makes it back to the town square. And the dragon lands. 20 groups of townspeople formed around the circle, ready to run in different directions if something bad happens.

The dragon thunders that someone has stolen his hoard and we are to replace it. Tefydarian is the dragon's name. We are to bring a 1000 gold to his lair. He grabs a random woman and starts flying away. Oz jumps on him. Enna hits his foot, he turns around and breathes gas on all of us and slows the entire crowd. Praetus asks him why he's exacting revenge on us. He laughs maniacally. This is not typical copper dragon behavior: He sounds out of his mind. Oz tries to calm down Lana, grabbed by the dragon. The dragon flicks Oz off.

...now what?
