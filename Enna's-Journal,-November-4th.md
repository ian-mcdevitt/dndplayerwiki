Night of September 6th

These are pending problems:
Dragon is flying back north, with a kidnapped member of the town.
We have 8 days until the next werewolf attack.

Peter Spiderbash approaches them, saying that was his daughter that was taken away. We assure him and her younger brother (Justin) wants to help. When the family first came to Evenbrook, as they were building their home, the older brother (Timothy) killed a large trap door spider -- hence their name.

We take inventory of everyone, and meet briefly with the clergy. Hakour is still no where to be found. When asked, Telsa looks like she's hiding something. We decide to discuss what our next move is. Some of the town's people want to stay and hear what has to be said; they rest will be filled in in the morning.

“Does anyone know about this dragon?” Praetus asks the crowd. They are some stirs amongst some of the halflings. They say beasts have a tendency to attack the town, for no reason. No correlation with the time of year, most activity is to the north, although the south is water, so... yeah. A huntsman mentioned a crop fail 15 years ago and the townspeople hunted more up the north. Arothotor says that the crop fail was caused by locusts. There was also a flood, and a plague in earlier years. One of the Firemaws says that his sister went crazy and killed his brother when the plague came. She was the only one to go crazy. Geas is something that fits all of these things, which is capable by druids.

The town has no means to pay the dragon, and not enough means to fight it. Our current plan is to leave at dawn, with Justin as a volunteer.
