A bronze dragon flies into Evenbrook in the middle of the night, we try to distract him away from the town's people to no avail.

The dragon (Tefydarian) thunders that someone has stolen his hoard and we are to replace it. We are to bring a 1000 gold to his lair. Praetus asks him why he's exacting revenge on us. He laughs maniacally; this is not typical copper dragon behavior. He sounds out of his mind. 

He grabs a random woman and starts flying away, despite our best efforts.

We head three days north of town to find a giant underground cavernous system (shaped like an upside town tree from what we can gather) with Jim exploring it. We head through one of the passage ways, and after fighting some obstacles, come to find three jailed prisoners of the dragons. We free Keyleth, an elven woman from Titanrock, Lana Spiderback from Evenbrook, and another older man, Vincent from Titanrock.

We finally find the copper dragon's lair, Tefydarian. We also find the corpses of genetically mutated copper dragon wormlings. There is a crown next to Tefydarian, and he accuses us of trying to steal his babies, unable to see that they are mutated and dead. We dispel magic on the crown and Tefydarian breaks down, realizing the truth and coming out of the fog that the crown was keeping him in.
