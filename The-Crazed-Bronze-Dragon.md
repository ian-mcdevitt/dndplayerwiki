A bronze dragon flies into Evenbrook in the middle of the night, we try to distract him away from the town's people to no avail.

The dragon (Tefydarian) thunders that someone has stolen his hoard and we are to replace it. We are to bring a 1000 gold to his lair. Praetus asks him why he's exacting revenge on us. He laughs maniacally; this is not typical copper dragon behavior. He sounds out of his mind. 

He grabs a random woman and starts flying away, despite our best efforts.
