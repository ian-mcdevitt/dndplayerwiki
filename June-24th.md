Sometime during September 28th (no light down here fuck)

Time to strategize while we rest awhile. Set the nearby field on fire, and during the distraction, rush into The Keep and attack the Elder Brain. We receive word from Oz's dragon that 5 mindflayers (one of them being very large) and 20 duergar are making a B line toward us. I send to Bldrlplll telling him to come quickly. The other duegar that intend to help us are not here but in their homes still. We sent two of the duegar out to retrieve some other duegar.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We make it out alive, after sustaining damage from so many mindblasts. The mindflayers alternated their attacking, which is probably the only reason we are still alive. Bldrlplll informs us that there is 8 mindflayers left after will the 4 and the huge one. We did lose one duegar of our own. Bldrlplll also managed to eat one of the mindflayers brains and gained some insight, after dealng with the fact that committed an almost unspeakable act. They have 3 thoons, 2 trolls, 3 nothics, 8 quagoths, and 8 mindflayers. The 4 mindlfayers that attacked us were not in contact with the Elder Brain; Bldrlplll sensed something else controlling them. We gathered some more picks and shields from the fallen enemy duegar. Prateus obtains the crystalline weapon that the Thoon was weilding, which turns out to be magical. 

All of our help is converging to the Keep. It is not occupied and looks like it was built for appearances since it looks so unused, but it is functional with murder holes, etc. There is 51 one us total with the willing duegar lock ourselves in the Keep to talk. Prateus suggests to send 10 duegar to go gather Barrellstalk sap (flammable) for some additional fuel for the fight, but we decide it's not worth it. Oz suggests series of skirmishes to see what we're up against with incoming groups. We do send a duegar to get some flour to help us detect invisible duegar. We have 500lb of flour that Oz will go first, invisible and flying, to drop it down. 

5 ranks of 10 going in, with Praetus and Bldrlplll in the frontish, and myself in the middle, Oz scouting ahead. March.

Large building in the south of the town. So humid. And wet and sticky and gross. 200ft down a ramp, sloping down and to the right. We encounter one mindflayer, who broadcasts for us to leave or be slaughtered. We continue forward.  After broadcasting a bullshit image of 30 mindlfayers and 100 trolls, we runs away. We continue. We come upon the capture pits and thrall barracks, and scout inside to see if we can get more bodies on our side. The barracks are emptied (looked to be in a hurry). We take 4 war picks that are left. The pit is littered with bodies, all the captured killed recently. Continue.

The hallway splits and we take the most direct route to the Elder Brain which means going through the bazaar. We are forced to break ranks due to the narrow hallways. It looks like the bazaar hasn't bee used in years, dust everywhere, rotten wood. We keep Oz's owl and one duegar behind to give us a warning if anybody decides to flank us. We come to a massive chamber, with a structure in the middle resembling a statue of the world being held up my water. There are holes all over the walls covered in membranes: their living quarters. Oz flys around the room examining. 

The hallway to the nutrient vats and laboratory has 8 quagoths and 2 trolls ready to attack. Oz poofs his owl here to watch that hallway while we continue to the Elder Brain room. 
The birthing pods has 3 thoon hulks, 3 mindflayers, and 20 duergars at the ready. 
The hallway to the Elder Brain has 3 mindlfayers, 3 nothics, and 20 duergar enemies at the ready. 

Oz circles back to us, to let us know what's up. 2 mindflayers ad 10 duegar are unaccounted for.

The back 20 duergar we tell to turn invisible and wait for the inevitable flank and counter flank them.
