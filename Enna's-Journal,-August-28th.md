We hop on the boat, across the lake. Sleep. We ask him again his name and where he is from now that he is calmer. He starts to carve symbols into a tree. Oz finds that comprehend languages reveals to be his name. After seeing a worked up, excited Praetus, he silences himself again. Seems a little PTSD, a reaction. His white clothes change to a white robe, slowly, over the course of the trip back.
We ask him what he remembers if anything. He writes out, in symbols, Utureshk.
Utureshk, as far as I know, has a link with the â€œLiving Gate" but I have no idea what that even is.

Peter's abilities are similar to mind flayers. Is Peter an experiment? Is something residing in him?

Upon arriving back in town, we talked to Jim the wizard. I got Jim to dispel magic the weed invested garden at the Bronzeleaf residence (which was 	discovered earlier when arriving in the town). Seems to work.

Found the bridge that Oz had John Frostmantle build burned and destroyed.
We consulted Jim about that. Who is flippant with the three of them, implying that since the three of them came, a lot of trouble has come with us. 

Illusory terrain was cast by Jim to produce a fake bridge. Jim alarms it and the three stake it out. A weasel appears. Praetus and I chase after it, eventually losing it, but find that these are not the normal actions of a weasel.

A man approaches Praetus about sheep attacks on his farm. Praetus goes to investigate a sheep carcass and finds that it is consistent with a werewolf attack. Praetus goes to the temple to consult with the other clerics. One confides in him that a man came to confess about being a werewolf.

Praetus distrusts one cleric in the temple, but not sure who yet (possibly Shae?)
Our house is done (so much planning, seriously, it was way too much fun laying out the floor plan for our house), and we move in. 

A knock on the door reveals a woman in hysterics, her house destroyed. Windows broken, place ransacked. Family of ten dragonborns (the Firemaws) living in a two bedroom house. Is the magic the same? They even asked the neighbors (the Snowlights, tieflings).

Oz proceeds to help repair some of the home.
I go to find Jim, and burns my face off trying to read his books.
Praetus goes on a picnic with Telsa. 
I goes fishing and see a vision of a man in white and a huge pill bug dying simultaneously, a man turning into a wolf, the pill bug's legs twitching, and the wolf reverting back into a man.

Praetus makes a cleric (Adrian Downwhisper): He has found a young man (Adrian) to carry on Lathander's teachings while he is gone.

As we walk into town after Praetus' sermon, some locals start a fight to get us to leave town.
