When Enna goes to explore the town, she comes across a family of dwarves with a very overgrown garden. The weeds and overgrowth is strangling the families edible plants, and every day, the overgrowth gets worse.

After talking to a member of the clergy, we find that it was magically and intentionally done to the families garden.

Jim the Wizard manages to dispell the magic, and it seems to work. For now.
