75 miles eat of Evenbrook
Where the new caravan is heading to expand trade into the town.
The trade caravan was a success. All of the good transport were bought and all of the goods brought back were bought by the people of Evenbrook.
We find that the town has very skilled silversmiths. Jewelry is a hot comodity here.
