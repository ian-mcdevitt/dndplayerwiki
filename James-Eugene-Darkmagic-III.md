Not a while lot if known about Jim.

He is approximately 40 years old, from what he can tell, human, pale, with slicked back black hair. He prefers to wear black on most occasions. He's also a very powerful wizard.

It is known that he knows Evenbrook relatively well, bet he keeps himself secluded from the rest of the town. He loves to learn and explore and has quite the library. He employs two scribes: Thomas and Pietro. 

He is pretty dependable, for the most part, and I think has developed a love/hate relationship with the three of us. He is knowledgable and powerful. He has recently discovered a huge cavernous system up north, that resembles a tree with its long winding tunnels. He is meticulously making steps and exploring.

He's a little reckless and spontaneous. We found of that he doesn't have too much concern for human life, as seen by his flippancy with his diciplanary hearing with a school he is employed by. 

He is a reliable source when we have questions about the town, and is usually around to help when we need it. We like to think of him a good friend, even if he doesn't quite consider us his yet.
