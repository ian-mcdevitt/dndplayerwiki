Morning of September 27th

Bldrlplll informs us that we killed the last of the quaggoth jailors. We explore the previously gas filled room. We see the stuffed animal heads and trophies. There's a head of a hooked horror and another beast. The inscriptions on the trophies are for engineering/science things, mostly clockworks. Luan Phien won all of these, the guy in the tomb we destroyed earlier. As we're looking at the things, the rooms rotate again. Oz starts mage-handing the smaller trophies for fear of setting off traps. Oz starts to slice the pipes that are holding up the trophies to force them to slide off, and they do, and get dented up. Oooooh real precious metals. Praetus works on breaking the bases off, which are useless. 

We open the curtain and continue down the given hallway with all the turning. We come into a room and there are twenty five more dwargar statues. Praetus tries to read the inscription on the neck to see if it's the same as the previous ones, but the head is solidly on. Praetus waits 4 minutes, just before the room rotates, to knock the head off and read it. No inscriptions. He knocks all the heads off. Oz looks down both hallways, one on the nice wall and the other on the older looking wall. Both yield hallways. 

We opt for the shittier hallway. We enter a rough-hewn room. There are prayer rugs in front of alters and parts (some broken some not) of the statues we just saw. The alter is hallowed to a God, but it's creating an area of psychic vulnerability. Mindflayers worship Ilsenine, the goddess of mindflayers. Oz inspects a hallway that has a light source, which we see is an orb. We go a T and recognize the hallway going right (rotting brains and stuff). We go left, Praetus being very cautious of traps.

We enter a room. There are weapon racks, holding weapon handles... but no metal or blades. The room is also covered with ash. Oz touches the “ash” and it's sharp, like it's metal. It's also a bronze, rusty color. There are footprints in the “ash”. We can't identify the print, but we can tell it's quadrupedal. Bldrlplll identifies it as a rust monster. Oz makes a loud noise and nothing happens. We move on, heading straight. We enter another room, and there's a table with beakers and other arcane paraphernalia and a large tome. Oz attempts to comprehend the qualith tome. All the books in the room are also in qualith. I attempt to identify a snot-like substance in a large beaker. Praetus attempts to look look in a hole 6 feet up in a wall. 

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Fucking rust monsters fucked up Praetus. Fuck. 

The snot is cerebrospinal fluid. Gross. The words he books in tome hurt Oz trying to understand them.  Bldrlplll tries to relay the information in the books for us and they hurt too. We discuss infiltrating the mindflayer home, Lagurno.  Bldrlplll reveals that thralls do the hunting for the mindflayers and shows us through a series of images how to get into the mindflayer city. He says he will bring us down in ropes, and presumably Oz would be invisible with his dragon. 

We decide to explore the remaining unexplored parts of the prison. Noooot much. We leave. 

Bldrlplll explains some of the workings and traditions of the mindflayers and their city. We decide to not go into the maze until tomorrow, given our resources. We decide to go to a nearby roper cave, clear it out, and stay in it until tomorrow. 

We enter the cave and Bldrlplll detects their thoughts to pinpoint their locations.  They are hungry and likely to attack us throughout the night. We negotiate our safety for food for them. We plan to drag some quaggoth bodies back for them to feed on, but Bldrlplll says that they will let us pass and then they will jump us. Time to kill them.

We back pedal and fire and hit them from forever away. Easy.

We chill out, with some dim light from an orb. Two drow approach the cave and ask “Who is responsible for the source of light?” in a  language we do not understand. They ask again in elvish. Praetus tries to sound like a dwargar, but they call our bluff and advance.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We killed both of the drow. 

Their insignia (found on a parchment that they were carrying) says they hail from House Relon-Shynt. Praetus nabs their shield. Oz takes some of the poison bolts. 

We go sleep.
