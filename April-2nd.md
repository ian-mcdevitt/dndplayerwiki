Morning of September 24

We decide to talk to Hakour about what the dryads told us yesterday. On our way into the prison, John Farguard stops us, to warn us that the towns people won't vote for us if we know how much we are visiting Hakour and how they want him hung. We ask him to step aside and tell him this is our business. He steps aside.

Oz jumps in and accuses him of lying. He beats around the bush, and after some threatening, we ask who his “Piscathcianess” is. He is taken aback but does not answer. Suddenly, we hear warning horns. We run out to see a flying white banner to the west. It slightly resembles Lathander's symbol. We wait at the wall with Lawrence Commonshield, who reports that it's about a half dozen coming toward us.

We decide to advance, with arrow support. We see that the banner is very crappy looking, and that the pact advancing are gnolls. Once they see Praetus, they start barking excitedly. There are 5 total, of the 15 that we left alive. They say that after their parents died, The Fangs attempted to bring them until their fold, and after seeing the brutality, they wanted to leave those ways and become good. They want help to be good. We respond “of course!” They want us to deal with the Fangs in the best way we can, so that they may continue living at the temple. We agree to go the temple and help them, and camp out by the river so that they can rest for the night.

Praeuts goes to tell his flock that he's leaving, I talk to KP about going to the temple tomorrow. Oz trains the guard, and we go to sleep.

Morning of September 25th

1 day of travel to the temple at a quick pace. Praetus made them all tunics of Lathander. We makes it there, and there is a hidden boat, not in the usual place. We take two trips across and the gnolls just charge through. We follow. They open and go a secret passage that we never notice. We enter a room with 10 other gnolls there, and the gnolls were following bark triumphantly at them, expressing that they found help. They say there used to be 20 of them, but the Fangs keep killing them. And that they keep increasing in numbers. Oz goes to scout outside to see what direction the Fangs are coming from and finds nothing. 

We spend the evening making a barricade at the entrance of the temple.
