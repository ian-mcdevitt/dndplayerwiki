Night of September 14th

As soon as we start getting comfortable and ready to go to sleep, Adrian knocks on our door. He quadrupled Oz's money. On the way there, they heard tell of a dragon (of an undisclosed color) but did not encounter one. The people of Titanrock were kinda resistant to trade at first, kinda insulted, but Adrian did sell all the their wares, and bought others.

Titanrocks blacksmith is sub-par, but they have awesome silver smiths, and all the jewelry they brought back with them immediately sold out in Evenbrook.  Overall it was good. 

We go to bed.

Morning of September 15th

We attend the morning sermons at the temple. Telsa's is very somber. Praetus preaches forgiveness. Auruthator is recounting the events, including Jim. I fill in Hakour's spot to his few followers, divulging to them what happened. Shae is going about her normal business. The sermons end, and some people remain after.

I talk to a few, and find that they are peeved that they were left out of any decisions or information regarding Hakour being behind the attacks. I get slightly defensive, telling we really didn't know until yesterday. I invite them to talk to me if they want more information about what happened, and they kinda dismiss me.

Praetus talks to another part of the leftover group, explaining to them what happened.

Keyleth tends to her garden and gains a healer's kit.

Oz goes to harrass Jim, knocking down Jim's door in the process, asking him about his dead baby dragon souls crown. Jim tells him to go away and proceeds to go back to the sleep.

We plan to fill all of the town on Zari Day (Day of the Full Moon) and give Jim a medal. Zari Day celebrates the world, originally made by the elves. Day drinking day. Since werewolves are still a thing (even though we know differently now), it is a military like celebration. Udul and Zari reflect off each other and create a beautiful spectacle, happening once a year.

I go hang out with Thor. He's related to the king of Garganta, 65 years old, and came over 15 years. 

Praetus talks logistics with Adrian about the trade. And later goes to talk to Hakour about what we will tell the town tomorrow.

Keyleth talks to Adrian about Titanrock. She wants Adrian to sell her shop/house, and gives him permission to do so.

Around 6pm, Oz is hauling wood home to make a shed for our house. At the forest line, he hears crashing trees. Oz sends to us to come and help. We fight the two ettins at the river by our house. Keyleth turns into a very sexy well endowed ettin by altering herself, and manages to distract them.
After taking considerable damage, the ettin that Praetus was grappling drops is weapons, and when asked who sent him, he says a green dragon, a little unsure. The other one just runs away, after finding that Keyleth's looks lied to him. Praetus asks why he was he was here, and he pitifully states he just started running and wanted to hit things. We know that ettins are extremely territorial, so this is odd. Oz's owl will follow the tree ettin to see where it goes.
