Praetus, Enna, and Oz decide it would be good of the town to expland it's trade into neighboring areas. 

A bridge was built, and we went around to see if anyone would be interested in bringing their goods into a new town. We got a relatively positive response.

The caravan left on the morning of September 6th, with Adrian Downwhisper (his new Lathander cleric) to Titanrock, a town 75 miles east of Evenbrook.

The caravan returns to the town on the night of September 14th. Adrian reports that he has quadrupled Oz's money.The people of Titanrock were kinda resistant to trade at first, insulted even, but Adrian did sell all the their wares, and bought others.

Titanrocks blacksmith is sub-par, but they have awesome silver smiths, and all the jewelry they brought back with them immediately sold out in Evenbrook.  Overall it was good. 

The caravan also made a successful and profitable second trip. 

We plan on expanding trading relations with Titanrock before pursuing Riversmaw.
