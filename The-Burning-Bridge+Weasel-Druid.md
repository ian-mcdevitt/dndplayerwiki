Oz asks John Frostmantle to assist him with building a bridge so that the town of Evenbrook may expand their trade with other neighboring towns. He agrees and it is built in 3 days.

A few days later, we found the the bridge burned down and destroyed. We consulted Jim the Wizard about it who is flippant with the three of them, implying that since the three of them came to Evenbrook, a lot of trouble has come with us. 

Illusory terrain was cast by Jim to produce a fake bridge. Jim alarms it and the three stake it out. A weasel appears, setting off Jim's alarm. Praetus and Enna chase after it, eventually losing it, but find that these are not the normal actions of a weasel, but the way and direction it was running. We're thinking Druid, at this point.

John Farguard, captain of the town guard, says a lot of the events going on are consistent with a Druid (the garden, the bridge, etc). Actions were performed before dawn and are nature related. 

Enna and Praetus go to investigate Duncan Commonshield about the Daybrook wereworlf attacks, who describes issues that started three months ago. He confirmed with a few stories of druid consistent incidences aw well.
