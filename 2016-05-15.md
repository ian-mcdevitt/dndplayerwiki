Dearest Mother,

It finally happened. I finally understand the Bladesong. Admittedly, it's not quite the one you showed me; it's got more of a northern flair to it. But a Bladesong it is nonetheless, and not a moment too soon!

You see, we were beset by bandits, of sorts. I and a few others, Haelynn included, were hired to recover what they had stolen, and tracked them to their lair. They did not relinquish their ill-gotten gains without a fight, however, and by the end of it, we had reclaimed what we had come to find.

I met an interesting and confounding circumstance, though, when Arathar, a knight from Candlekeep (I think that's part of Amn), demanded the leader's head. It appears that justice is meted out by the strong in the North, rather than by the wise. It seems quite an inconvenient and messy way to go about things. In the end, I was unable to compromise with Arathar, whose apparent virtues are incontrovertible.

In any event, I cannot wait to show you all that I have learned and am learning. I will continue to discover this new and exciting Bladesong, and will share with you more details of the Art when I can. For now, though, suffice to say that I was inspired by a certain bird that is only native to the North.


Kindest Regards,

Arygos Stamaraster
