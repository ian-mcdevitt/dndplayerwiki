Morning of September 27th

Bldrlplll informs us this used to be a lively temple, so there's a lot of temple-y stuff around. He says we must have encountered his jailors, which we hadn't. Oz asks how any turns off the hallways since he lost saw his jailors: 288. The sad sack has no concept of time.  We leave the room and encounter a wall.  5 minutes later wall. Wall. Wall. Opening! 8 qualgoths in a room.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We got our asses handed to us a little. But we still beat them.

We decide to short rest. We need it. We throw the bodies into the nearby pit and reset the trap. We have Bldrlplll in the room kinda has bait, and plan to ambush anything that tries to attack him while we short rest in hiding. We hear more qualgoths approaching. Bldrlplll tells us telepathically they know we're here. One of them starts running toward Bldrlplll.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We kill the two. We keep going down the hallway assuming that there are more of them. 

We come across a more open area with an alcove of old trophies, medals, and animal heads. As we approach, Praetus hits a trip wire. A heavy curtain blocks off the hallway. Poisonous gas fills the area. Oz goes down to tear down the curtain and plug the pipes. More qualgoths. We are not prepared.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

In between trying to focus fire frenzy-ing monsters and avoiding gas, oh dear Lord was that close.

SHORT REST.
