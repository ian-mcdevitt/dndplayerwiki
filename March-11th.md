September 19th evening

We're in the naga room, after the fight, the naga teleporting away at the last minute. Imputress sends me saying “You damn fools.” I reply back, “You have your damn spells, fool.”

Oz wants to go in the hole on the stage in the room that Imputress came out of of, in search of the spells. Praetus and I follow him. Oz collapses some smaller holes diverging from the main one. The end point is a chemical laboratory, but looks like it was ransacked by Imputress. Oz pockets some of the dry pages, drinks a bubbling purple potion and turns tiny.

I pick up a slender piece of wood with blue glass at thse end and pocket it. Praetus looks around and finds a secret bookcase tunnel. Oz goes down, being the smallest, and sees a point of light facing upward (his lance tells him it's the way out). We plan to backtrack and go out the main entrance to meet with Tefadarian tomorrow. We encounter the troll on the way back, after smashing the ladder in the shaft. And another female troll from the pantry room.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Oz sprays acid all over the two trolls. Praetus takes all the damage. I try and hypnotize them.

We make it up the ladder, up the shaft, and out of the cave.

We rest by one of the rivers outside of the upside down world tree and long rest.

Morning of September 20th.
