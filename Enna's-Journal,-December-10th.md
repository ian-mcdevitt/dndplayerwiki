September 10th (afternoon)

Oz had a crown! Which lets him have deformed dragon baby spirit things! Yay?
* Hudraer
* Razeth
* Ohen (the special one)

Keyleth, Vincent, and Lana are with us. Oz rummages through Jim's office. I deliver Lana back to the Spiderbashes. Praetus wants to take Vincent to the temple. There seems to be a quiet murmur in the town. As Praetus approaches the temple, there are a bunch of bear corpses (remnants from a party in the town). He is told that 12 some bears attacked the town, and the guards fended half of them off, and they killed the other half. Luke, the refugee guard, explains he just fended them off. 

Enna approaches the Spiderbash residence, and upon seeing Lana, they rejoice. I return to the town square near the temple.

Oz tried to break into the tavern... for whatever reason. Oz encounters a family that is leaving town, exclaiming how they don't want to be in a town that is being targeted by dragons and bears. They say they're heading to Titanrock, despite Oz telling them that a dragon attacked Titanrock as well.

We find, talking to the towns people who witnessed the bear attacks, that a thunderstorm happened at the same time, but everyone shrugs it off as insignificant. The Amadeus (the hunter that came with us) says he encountered nothing strange on the way back.

Oz goes to Hakour's home, who is hungover like the rest of the people we encountered. I notice as we leave that Hakour drops his hungover persona. Lying bastard. We pass another family heading toward Rivermaw. We try to persuade them to stay, because we can't protect them there. The man (Pontius Fynash) says he can't support his family on trench digging wages. I propose that if I can get John Farguard to pay him more to join the guard (he owes us a favor) he should stay and protect his family. He gives us until tomorrow.

We go back home. Praetus plants potatoes. Oz carpenters a a planters box. I go to John, and the most he can do is waive Pontius' taxes. Pontius agrees. Hopefully, the caravan will come back with more people and goods to stimulate the economy so the guard can have better pay.

Oz checks on Kalt Peter. He looks malnourished. Oz tells him about the tree-shaped cave, which Peter is familiar with. He tells him, “Never go back. Too dangerous. Dragons are the least of your worries.” He says he will NOT come with us. He says that information comes from someone else's memories.
We ask him if he has any memories of his own. He says “Death.”
He says he has a “bald man's” memories. We give him a mirror. He says “I am the man... that killed myself.”
“Who are you?”
“...I don't know.”

We decide that we'll chill for three days, as opposed to going to the temple to explore, and wait for the werewolf attacks to come again.

Every attack could have been perpetrated by a druid... Praetus finds that out after his sermon from townspeople. Oz trains the guardsmen to be better fighters. I fish and bond with Keyleth.

Two nights pass. There is heavy rain. Oz is training the guards again. SUDDENLY: A lightning bolt strikes Oz. He is struck again and falls unconscious. He is carried inside, and one of the guards heals him enough to awaken. We notice Oz is late and go and find him. We ask Ian what happened and he recalls the events. 

Oz says, “I dodged lightning. Twice.”

Praetus and I go outside to investigate. I detect a faint aura of magic, but that's it. We go home safely.

Morning of September 14th 

We check in at the Daybrooke farm. Rodrick made friends with one of the animals and seems likes an entirely different person. Oz gives ToughBottom words of wisdom... because that's relevant. Come nightfall, Oz is training the guards, Praetus is asleep at the farm, and I'm watching the sheep, waiting for the werewolf. During the watch, one of the sheep just fall down. After a minute, another one does. I wake them up, detect magic (nothing) and continue to watch. Nothing else happens into the morning.
