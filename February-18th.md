Morning of September 17th 

Oh God, what happened last night?

Oz comes to the temple to find me, half naked, and asks me to text Tefydarian. I do and ask for an audience in 3 days. He says that's fine. Praetus brings the refugees food over the last few weeks. And does some other things things, including tell Adrian to leave with the next caravan in 6 days, when we get back. We leave to meet the dragon.

There's a troll by the river, and we try to sneak past him. And we succeed. And then we march.

Morning of the September 18th

March.

We wake up. There are no rust monsters. We travel. We encounter a pack of bears. We fight. We win. 7pm we make it to the bad lands.
