Late morning of October 13th

All the kuo-toa are dead... Goddamn. Wave after wave after wave bombarded us. Oz and I get a new tentacle weapons. We're n the adjacent room, after advancing on the kua-toa. We attempt to rest in an out-pouch in the room, between the door we came through and a waterfall making considerable noise. 

We successfully rest and I bind with a new vestige, Focalor, and go back to the statue that they were worshiping. It is a statue of an aboleth. We go up the stairs where more kua-toa came from in the previous fight. We smell rotting fish as we climb the stairs. As we enter a room, there is a walkway around a pit. We see creatures thrashing in the pit of water underneath. We briefly get the idea that we should jump in the pit, and then decide that is the worst idea ever. We snipe the creatures below, and Oz looks down to see that they were eating a kua-toa, in what seems to be a ritualistic sacrifice. We found the creatures to be slod tadpoles. Nothing else is here, so we go back down the stairs and down the other path. We come to a meandering cave of water and land, with another waterslide/waterfall. We make our way down the waterfall. As we make our way over to it, we notice some stalagtites that have that symbol on it that we saw previously on walls and the prisoners. It's not a stalagtite. It's a roper.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We killed the ropers. 

Oz and Praetus hear more voices in their heads. Oz detects magic to see if he's being watched. He feels nothing. We continue to move to the waterfall and slide down it. We come to another cave with another waterfall advancing down. Down the other waterfall. 

We end up in a large room, filled with water, with an island surrounded in colorful coral in the middle. There are shimmering orbs of water floating in the air. The water is very inky. As we get our bearings, we get the sense that something is moving in the water. We also hear, broadcasted, in a loud booming voice, that we are in Da Ultino's lair, and that at one time, all Spirits answered to Da Ultino. The voice threatens us, saying he will rip Lathander down, and that Oz's friends will know no peace. He says the Gods destroyed the most beautiful creature: Utereshk. Oz tells me to shoot into the darkness, and I do.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We fought Da Ultino, who had the form of an aboleth, and he eventually fell. He summoned water weirds repeatedly, and as we damaged him, ghostly figures erupted from him, like helmed horrors and spectators. At one point, I was tricked into believing I was fighting Hakour and later was in a box. 

After closer inspection at the large orb in the center, it stills and forms a portal, but quickly collapses. Then the cave starts to rumble. I touch one of the three smaller water orbs and find myself in a bubble of water and start advancing up the waterfall. Praetus and Oz soon follow in their own water orbs. The orbs pass through the room with the ships, in a room with slods we have not been in, up another waterfall, and eventually we end up in the entrance room. The bubble deposit us, and we swim the hell out of there. The tunnel that we came in from collapsed, so we go down another. We surface in the marsh. We can no longer feel the rumbling, but off in the distance, we see an area of ground sink 50 feet down. 

Fuck everything about this place. We don't feel safe enough to stay here, so we get out the compass and head back to the Living Gate. We make it to the end of the marsh, and into jungle. We keep marching. Praetus is especially exhausted from all the swimming, and we finally make it.

Hut. Sleep.

Morning of October 14th

I contact Ushay immediately upon waking, and he appears to talk to us. Da Ultino was the Spirit of authority, and he has since been replaced. 10,000 years ago, he died. Ushay doesn't know how he came back, but aboleth's are corrupted spirits. Utereshk had something to do with his coming back; she is corrupting Spirits through the Gate. Nothing goes in the Gate and nothing comes out. So how do we stop her? We need to improve upon the Living Gate to really seal Utereshk away, but the shard minds keep sloughing off the Gate. But the shard minds have three different motives: make their own society and join together, join together for the Living Gate, or separate entirely. 

I ask if Ushay can talk to Adelum somehow, so we may have a piece to scry for a shard mind with. Ushay walks up the Living Gate, and silently converses with it. A two foot diameter chunk of the Living Gate breaks off, sprouts arms of and legs. He is Adelum.

When he became Adelum, he entered into a cycle. The Living Gate slowly breaks over tens of thousands of years. It will break. Utereshk will break free. She will be thwarted. And the cycle will continue. Everyday, Adelum fights to keep the Living Gate up. He shares what he must go through with Oz, and Oz falls to his knees, exhausted, from thousands of voices demanding him to help them. I inquire about other Spirits helping, and he responds that they all stay far away, and probably don't know about their own eventual demise. 

The Gods waged a war against the Spirits and won the first time, and Utereshk reeped the benefits. The cycle has been completed once. It will happen again. Mortals cannot do anything in their lifetime to stop it. 

All the Gods cannot match Utereshk's power. It is unclear if all the Spirits could outmatch her. We decide that an Order must be created to try and unify the Spirits to solve the problem rather than putting it off: destroying Utereshk. About 100 pieces of the Living Gate break off, and declare themselves the Order of the Sun and Moon, and they will make it their mission to unify the Spirits. I resign that I will do the same. We ask Jim for a sigil sequence for a portal so that the shard may enter the Prime Material to fulfill their task. The portal will be through Egerfort, and we plan to go through there as well. 

We end up in hallway in Egerfort, and the shard minds go through various portals to various locations in the school. 

Fastforward.

Oz runs for mayor and wins and plans to revolutionize Evenbrook, making it bigger and better than it even was. Adrian is in charge of trade and just expand like crazy, turning it into a kingdom. 

Praetus is helping the Order of the Sun and Moon. His basic goal is to go back to Evenbrook, cultivate someone to take his place at the temple. He will use a growing Evenbrook to facilitate this. 

I will place myself in Egerfort and spread my knowledge and make students aware of Spirits and what we are trying to accomplish with the Order. I'm also traveling when I can to communicate with Spirits to convince them that Utereshk needs to be destroyed to break the cycle. I know it's a slow process, but I have 600 more years to do it, to make Spirits more known again, and to bring down this evil looming over the world. 

The End.
