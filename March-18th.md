Morning of September 20th 

I identify my wand â€“ it's a magic missile wand with 23 charges. Cool.

We wake up and go to see Tefydarian. We got our rope back, and use it again in the 2nd cave. Oz is proficient with knots. Same reliefs. Same brambles, except they are moving out of the way for us this time. The dragons wealth pile looks a lot bigger since we've last been here. But the baby nest is now gone. 

Tefydarian perks up, and seems very lax about the meeting. We thank him for Oz's lance and the history he provided us. 

Tefydarian isn't of much help, but does say it's unusual for a green dragon to seek revenge for something, but they do like having power over someone (like Hakour) because they are weaker. He also says that it was incredibly foolish of Hakour to try and think he could raise a green wrymling without expecting something to go wrong. He rolls a scroll toward Oz when he asks for a ride home. It's a teleportation circle scroll.

We ask about the cave system itself before leaving. He says he owns half of it, and that his kobolds are clearing out the rest. Praetus asks about the cave itself, and the dragon states it came from a very nontraditional seed and it continues to subtly grow. Oz flies down the bottom of the cave tree, and finds just water, there, just magically there, splitting into 4 rivers flowing upward. 

I detect magic on the cave system: transmutation magic. Praetus wants to wait for three hours until the sun rises on the bottom of the pit, and connect to Lathander. He sees the world tree being an actual world tree (as it should have been) on this oblong island that we are on, Evenbrook being on the coast. Instead, it's a cavern system, and the badlands, being in the epicenter of island, is spreading. 

We make the teleportation circle at Jim's and Praetus lands right on top of Jim, breaking his chair. Jim, obviously pissed, throws us out. 

Praetus goes to meet with the carpenter, to see the cart that he is building for the caravan to sell goods. Oz is rebuilding the bridge with Frostmantle. I go talk to Kalt Peter about the world tree caves. He knows nothing of it, and says he's trying to figure out where he is from first. He eliminated all other planes and found that he is not from any of them. I suggest we go back to the temple soon so he can find out more about himself. He agrees.

Adrian is taking charge of the caravan: we are The Evenbrook Trading Company. We decide to throw a feast for all of those helping with the caravan preparations (Adrian, us three, Keyleth, and KP). Oz asks for a return on his investment again from Adrian. Adrian says they need oxen to make the trip quicker so that they can cut down on food costs and shave a day off the trip. I ask KP if he needs anything from Titanrock, and he produces a list of chemical reagents and animal bits. A lot of these things are expensive and we ask how he is going to pay for it. He produces an astral diamond like it's no big thing. Adrian promises to conceal it in a hidden pocket while he is in Titanrock to obtain thing things on KP's list. Oz trains the guards after the dinner, and does so very well.

Morning of September 21st
Praetus and I give our morning sermons. Praetus talks about new beginnings. I talk about political changes and the caravan bringing change and tie Xeriia (spirit of change) into it.

Three days until the caravan leaves! Praetus is still in the race, but Oz and myself have formally dropped out.

I meditate about the world tree, and receive a vision of a purple arch, with a spark seed-like thing in the middle. As it sparks, the purple color deepens, and the vision ends.

Oz goes gambling.
