Evening/night? September 28th 

There is carnage everywhere. So much blood. 

Praetus wants to attempt a short rest, despite some protests of “This is probably way too dangerous.” We have 23 duergar, ourselves, and Bubbles. They have 3 mindflayers, 4 quaggoths, 20 duergars, and 1 Elderbrain (that we know of) left to face. Hesitant to even short rest for an hour, we ask Bldrlplll what the enemy could do in an hour that would be to our disadvantage. He says maybe set up defensives, but they would probably be minimal. He also gives us a visual picture of the Elder Brain room. He plan to try and rest in the Plaza, where we just fought, and have Oz's owl scout the area, and use to duergar to watch as well, with their bags of flour to watch for invisible areas. While resting, we feel the humidity in the air get colder, and colder, and colder. The water from the fountain freezes over. I identify it as Eldritch magic, similar to that used by a warlock. We need to wait this short rest out, and despite our trepidation, resist moving toward the Elder Brain room to find out what's going on. 

We figure out our marching order, Praetus “inspires” the duergar, we give the enlarged duergar some of the thoon hulk clubs, and we go forward, with a hit squad in tow. 

We are waiting outside the Elder Brain room. Oz tries to peek around a corner. He is noticed. He backs up and tells us there are 6, 6, 5 (on the floor in front of the stairs) and 3  (at the top of the stairs) enlarge duergar with varying terrifying features (scarred around their necks with slimy skin, claws sprouting through their gauntlets , and terrifying horned ones) all well armored and equipped. The one duergar in the middle at the top is huuuuuuge, with massive armor and bleeding out of every joint. We then see 2 quaggoths and 3 mindflayers appear, who ask us for our terms. 

Oz: “The death of whatever is behind that door.”

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

Bldrlplll dies during the battle early on, after a mindflayer telekensis'd him into a trapped with dropped quaggoths from the ceiling resulting in them being bloodied and frenzied. The big bleeding duergar finally goes down, his plate mail disappearing. As the second to last enemy falls, the last mindflayer pounds on the door on up the stairs. Praetus uses his maul's ability to completely obliterate him. As we feel stronger after this fight, Praetus suddenly knows revivify and runs to Bldrlplll to save him. He's alive again!

I pick up a book on three summoning circles outside the main door. It is a Book of Binding. It's a book of binding vestiges to your soul. This would give me the option to learn to bind with Ushay... which is something I've been considering since interacting with Acheaudi. 

We open the door tot he Elder Brain room, after taking a short rest and learning some things with our new found experience. We go through a short narrow hallway, which opens to a room with a pool filled with a bright green liquid. Through the opaque festering fluid, we see the vague shape of something long, smelling like death. Bldrlplll said the pool is usually filled with tadpools and says the brain is dead. Outside the pool is a lone of mushrooms. We have heard rumors of faerie circles and hide a fey crossing. Oz crosses the mushroom line and disappears, and we all follow. It feels like jumping in a warm bath. We find ourselves in a clearing, the mushroom line now behind us. In front of us, is the most verdant forest we have ever seen. In the distance, we see the largest tree we have ever seen. 

...World Tree? Is that you?
