Morning of September 14th

I tell Praetus about the sheep falling over. He says that is not normal sheep behavior... but I didn't notice anything else that night...

We all attend Praetus' morning sermon. The town's people seem wary and all seem like they want to leave. We fill Keyleth in on all the events leading up to now on our way back home. We hear an explosion coming from the direction of Jim's house. We run down. It seemed to be contained. Pietro and Thomas are scribbling down notes. Jim, distracted and happy to be doing “experiments” says he tried to explode an octahedral glowing object. Praetus locates object to find it, since it kinda flew off in the distance. Praetus brings it back and tries to cut it and fails. I detect magic to find it radiates evocation energy. Oz deduces that it is absorbing energy, probably for defensive purposes.

Jim give Oz a book on dragons with a note in it, saying that this book might come in handy with his new found wormlings. Oz also talks to Pietro about lycanthropy; the fact that werewolves never stay in one place too long, and that they travel in groups. But the attacks on the farm have been going on for three months now, and there only seems to be one attacking the farm.

Praetus attempts to attune to the hedron. He has a floating hedron of absorption!

I ask Jim if he will camp out with us at the Daybrooke farm. He agrees. I go to Magnus and tell him what we are planning tonight. 

We all work on the garden for the rest of the day. Keyleth is growing herbs for her apothacary skills as well.

Keyleth, Praetus and I take shifts watching at the Daybrooke farm. Jim assures us that he set up a parameter of Alarm. Oz is training the guards (very well, I might add).

During Keyleth's watch, she hears screaming across town. She wakes us up, and we run over, Praetus leaving his stag Apa'ro behind at the farm. I send to Oz and we make a B line to the walking trees coming toward the town. There are flames flying through the sky at the 3 walking trees (presumably and hopefully from Jim). The Treants have a leader it seems, giving orders to the other two.

With Jim's help, we bring them down. Keyleth is the real MVP, all that fire damage from lightning strike. Oz and Keyleth proceed to aid the ones injured from the collapsed buildings that the treants were destroying. We heard them toward the temple and Shae is there to help them.
