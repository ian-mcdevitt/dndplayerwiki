September 10h

We want to explore the most easily accessible ones. We go into the second one, because Jim found chuuls in the first. We see life sized reliefs, but instead of going in, they curve outward. The pictures depict smiling dragons. Praetus and I start laughing uncontrollably for a moment. That was weird. Praetus pulls out his light sword, and we see a narrowing tunnel. 

We see four square raised tiles on the left side of the wall. Praetus immediately presses the red one when Oz told him too. It pushes in flush with the wall and the color changes to the color of the wall. Upon pressing the orange one, same thing happens, then the green. The green button gives way and reveals a small tube which emits a green gas, which inflicts harm. Orange and red buttons come out. We're thinking it's a Simon Says Game, and attempt to hit red, orange, blue green. The red button being pushed again reveals fire balls falling from the ceiling, hitting Praetus. Praetus, realizing it's a cycle, pushes them in the right sequence and a wall moves revealing a pile of gold. Something seems off... Oz throws a handaxe at the pile and the coins skitter like... bugs. Now that the fake gold bugs moved, it reveals a pile of copper.

The bugs follow us. I squish one and keep the gold part. Praetus does the same. 

Moving on!

We see vines as we continue, spikey vines. They grow back immediately upon cutting them. I throw a torch in and as it burns, we run through with minimal damage. The tunnel branches into three directions. We go to the right. The tunnel widens and we hear whispers. Praetus makes our presence known. Someone shouts “Please help us!” Three large cages sit on the opposite wall. In the left is a young woman, crying. The middle one has an old man chained to the wall. An older elven woman is in the last one. 

We free the elfen woman, who tells us she was kidnapped by a dragon and brought here. Praetus breaks  the other locks, frees the malnourished man, and Lana Spiderbash, who was the kidnapped townfolk we came to save.

Keyleth (the elfen woman) says she needs her things before we leave. Oz finds them and we leave. We hear rock against rock and start running toward the exit. Our exit is now blocked off, and we are forced to go down the middle path. A copper dragon face on the floor starts speaking: “Did you think you could get away so easily?” It becomes inanimate again. We continue. 

The tunnel opens into a room, that contains a giant pile of coins, a giant copper dragon sleeping on top of it. A second pile of coins, smaller than the first, has a hallow above it in the wall. Keyleth levitates and finds corpses of genetically mutated copper dragon wormlings. Oz and Praetus approach the dragon. Praetus finds a crown, emitting enchantment magic. Keyleth tries to take it, but the pile of coins makes some noise and the dragon rears up and roars: “Who are you to steal my babies?!”

When we direct them to the hallow of his dead babies, he says his babies are fine. He commands me to dance. Keyleth joins me in the distraction while Oz tries to take the crown. Keyleth tries to dispel the magic on the crown in the hopes of the dragon becoming sane again. Upon doing so, the dragon's eyes become brighter and he realizes his babies are dead. He says he's never seen the crown before in his life. We promptly leave with Lana and the man.

We go up the rope and out of the hole. We find Jim at the top, asking him about the dragons. He says he's seen like 3 or 4 fly in and out of here since he's been here. He teleports us back home to Evanbrook.
