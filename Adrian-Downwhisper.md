After confessing for taking his anger out on animals and repenting, Adrian was reborn as a Dawnbringer of Lathander. 

**Cleric 1**

He has several days experience giving sermons as a Dawnbringer, however he still has a way to go. 

He was selected by the party to lead a caravan to Titanrock, and has gathered around him a group of merchants and craftsmen to foster trade with our neighbors.
