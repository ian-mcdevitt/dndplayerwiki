Morning of October 2nd

REWIND A BIT. We wake up in the flump area. I ask Flumphert if anything unusual happened since we've been gone. He charades that there has been a mudslide at the entrance of the temple. Presumable someone is behind that... We make our ways up to talk to the gnolls about it. 

The gnoll numbers have thinned, going from 12 to 9. They're happy to see us, but weary. They said 3 of the got trapped behind the mudslide. They said the stone seemed to flow down the stairs... sounds deliberate to me. They look like they're low on food. They've tried breaking through, but the stone is too much.  

I send to Jim, asking if he's back in town yet and if he can help us out of the temple. He says he'll be there tomorrow morning. We give the gnolls the very last of our rations, and wait. 

As we prepare to go to sleep, suddenly the stone mud slides away, and there is Hakour, Apa'ro at his side. He says he needs our help. Oz immediately holds person. Apa'ro says, in common, that Hakour is not our enemy and that he was being controlled by an Abaleth. Oz binds him and drops it. 

We argue back and forth about how was in the right and who was in the wrong, but it eventually boils down to assumptions being handled wrong. Hakour scried us (Oz's ears burning) and saw us with mindflayers, and wanted to evacuate the time, and we are hostile because of the lies he was spreading. He says that Apa'ro told him he needs my Binding book to rid his connection with the Abaleth. I have heard of an Abaleth before, but I have the feeling it has to do with “His Fishy Sliminess.”

So the plan is to get back home, but go to sleep now, wait for Jim, and teleport back then.

Morning of October 3rd 

OH MY GOD. WE CAN SEE THE SUN. Praetus prays.

I send to Jim, asking when he'll be here, and he forgot, so I told him to stay there and I spend a little time skimming the Book of Binding to see what it's about, since Hakour is inquiring. Binders make a deal with another otherworldly being, and gain some of the attributes of the being, and the being benefits from the bond as well. It's like being a warlock, but more risky and less permanent. 

We fly on Oz's giant eagle form back to town. We land in the middle of town. A few people are milling about ,but stop suddenly upon seeing us. We quickly call a town meeting to explain everything. About 200 people showup. We clear up any discrepancies in stories. Oz exchanges his gems for money. I go and talk to the members of the clergy, who have said they are on good terms again. We divulge everything to them that transpired in the temple. They're reactions are varied, surprised to resigned.

I give Hakour the book to read, and I try to call upon Ushay for answers. Praetus confronts Hakour about his crimes and Hakour shuts him down, saying this is not the time and that there are bigger things to worry about.

I wonder off to try and contact Ushay. With Oz's tiny hut (representing the world and protection), he materializes. He looks more put together. We greet each other, and he says he has found his purpose. I ask for help, acknowledging the fact that I have taken more of a protective role and and am not sure of my cold bond with Acheaudi. He hands me two silver and cobalt rings, and says he will help me, and leaves. 

Hakour reads the book – a first hand account of someone learning binding for the first time. The writing becomes more and more hastily written and maddened. A final scratch at the back of the book says, “Vestiges are all that remains of Spirits.” Power is banished from the world when a Spirit dies, but the Vestige remains. There is also a massive ritual concerning Utureshk. We don't know anything about any of that. Hakour relays all of this to Praetus. 

We all eventually make our way to Jim's, Hakour wanting to know about the ritual, Oz wanting to bother him and steal his books? Jim yells at Pietro to help us and walks away. Praetus insults Pietro about his abilities but looks at the ritual anyway. He comprehends languages and Oz bothers Jim until he gives him a book of spells. I ask Jim about his disciplinary hearing, and he says he's supposed to teach a class, got a 300 yo man named Razu to sub for him, and he killed three students, and he was being held responsible, but he got off, so it's okay.

The ritual writing is in qualloth and it's about hundreds failed attempts to make this ritual happen. There are scribbles of corrections to improve the ritual, but it looks like no one even got close. 

Hakour asks Thomas about Abaleths and he pulls a book for him. Abaleths can turn mortals into thralls. Hakour knows he never quite reached this point. A spirit turns into an Abaleth when its concept drops out of favor, when people forget about it. Hakour wonders if this can be reversed...

I meditate on the rings and identify then as Rings of Focus. Two people wearing them can concentrate on each other's spells.  I ask Praetus is he will wear the other one and he agrees. We attune. 

Praetus is going to get platemail made by Lawrence Commonshield, who is doing very well with the caravan monies. He tells them three weeks minimum for 2 sets. 

We turn in for the night.

I have a crazy dream about being a bubble, being outside the bubble, and simultaneously inside the bubble. I wake up in a cold sweat and realize that Ushay is now my patron and that my tie with Acheaudi is severed. I feel so much better knowing the my patron shares my cause. 

Morning of October 4th

Hakour takes his spot back preaching, and I ask those who still follow me to come outside, and some do. Everyone sermons. Oz reads the ritual again. So much jargon he can no understand. 

The caravan is scheduled to come back today. Oz goes to ask Jim about the tree cave and he says he has gotten to the 6th cave with the steps. Through more of Jim's books we find that the Fey Wild is a reflection of the prime material plane and Spirits are very common there. This would kind of explain the connection between the portal and a Spirit/vestige...

Adrian is back with the caravan! Praetus wants to buy his platinum rings and buys one for everyone. Oz got his 5 gold doubled again and tries to sell the trophies, but we find out they're mostly tin. Praetus wants to wait until his armor is done to proceed with things. Hakour tells him we probably don't have the luxury of waiting. The thing that was talking to Hakour sounding angry and called us the Destroyers; it will most likely not wait. 

Off to the temple. We arrive at sunset. We rest inside and go to sleep.

Morning of October 5th

We make our way down to the maze. It takes about 2 hours. Down the spiral staircase into Lagurno. Meet the duergar. Into the sept. To the Elder Brain tank. To the Fey Wild circle.

Hakour communes with nature to find the way. But we realized we've been traveling for 7 hours at this point and we're tired. We rest there in Oz's tiny hut. The suns stay in the same position... dear Lord, that's disorienting. 

Morning of October 6th

As we back up camp the next morning, an Eledrin comes into the clearing, and comes straight up to me and tells me I'm beautiful and asked for my undying love. Wary, I dismiss him, and he leave me with a rose. Hakour says this is pretty typical and tole us to be thankful it wasn't something more dangerous. 

Hakour attempts to commune with nature, but doesn't here anything back... however, a large humanoid bird... lady... thing lands in the clearing and is there to answer Hakour's questions. Uuuhhh... Hakour asks about Spirits, and she says that other than the great tree, she is not aware of any others. She flies away.
