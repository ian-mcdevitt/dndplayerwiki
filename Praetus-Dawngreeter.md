*Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination. I will be the light for those who may lose their way. I will plant the seeds of hope and nurture growth where I find it. From death comes life. I will foster rebirth and renewal in all things.*

I find myself far from my homeland, among strange people and in a place where danger comes in every shade of imagination and from every direction around and within us. I have never felt more at home. I am invigorated at morning, and I am fulfilled when I bed down each night.

The refugees needed our help, and we set upon their captors with rightous fury. We shattered the bonds of enslavement and brought them to a new world. And we have found a people here who are honest and hard-working. They have welcomed us into their hearth and provided a new opportunity for everyone on that ship. We rended the vessel of the slavers end to end, and worked it into homes for the freed men and women. From death comes life.

I pray every morning and give thanks for the rebirth brought by the light. I renew my oaths and forge a path ahead. Around me, I have gathered a congregation. I am a light for them to find their way, and They shall be a light for others. Through cooperation we will bring a brighter future. 

There is light in the world, and it is us.
