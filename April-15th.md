Early morning of September 26th

We all pass the hell out, and the gnolls continue to party, and KP casts silence so we can all sleep I peace. As we wake up, now they are asleep. Praetus goes outside the temple to pray. KP looks excited to start exploring. Praetus cooks the sleeping gnolls food. Oz goes outside to inspect the boats (crudely made). I small talk to KP, who is completely unworried of what lies ahead. 

We start in, and we encounter flumphs, who appear happy to see us and happier in general. We eventually get to the iris room where we initially found KP. I lead KP around to all the statues to get his reaction. He looks tense and guarded, hiding his thoughts and feelings.  Oz and Praetus inspect the area and find little. KP walks down to what was his prison and just sits down, says he was in a statis and that there is more here. Praetus asks about the 6 spirits and I fill him in. Oz informed me that there is a magical light source that filters through this iris. I detect magic, and sense magic below me. After inspecting the floor, I find that the rings on the floor show evidence of scraping. I ask Oz and Praetus to help look for some sort of switch to activate the floor. Oz finds levers imbedded in the floor, and we start pulling them, and hear motion below us. As Praetus and Oz throw the last switch, the ground raises, then disappears, with no crash. The floor just faded away and there's a mirror directly below. We drop a rope and descend.

There's a hexagonal room, same size as above, and very dark. There's a ball of mirrors on 3 of the walls. And the mirror I the center of the room as two handles and looks like it can be moved. They rotates to the one mirror ball. A giant beam of light forms between the two. We hear a sudden thunderous crash of stone at each of the six corners of the room, and humanoid creatures with mirrors for faces emerge.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT LIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT PUUUUUUUUUUUUUZZLE

We swing the light around source around. Mirrors spawn and hit hard. We used the angle mirrors to create more beams. Oz polymorphed into a T-Rex when we basically already won.

We illuminate the three mirror balls, and absorb all the light, and the mirror in the middle of the room shatters, and swirls to form an elven.

OH MY FUCKING GOD.
