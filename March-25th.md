Evening of September 21st

Oz and I go and get drunk. Praetus prepares sermons for tomorrow.

Morning of September 22nd

I hungoveredly give a sermon in the morning and kinda suck at it. Praetus sermons about rebirth. I go fishing after. Oz goes scouting the northwest of town for oddities and finds nothing. He trains the guards after. Praetus attends to his flock and also talks to Hakour and asks about his atonement, which is awaiting on a new mayor to decide. Praetus asks Hakour if he knows about the badlands, and he does, and in turn asks if knows about the World Scar. Hakour says it exists because there is evil in the world. World Trees exist that aren't corrupted are guarded by the elves. Prateus asks about uncorrupting a world tree and Hakour says that depends on the source. Hakour says that he has spent the last 50 years trying to figure out what corrupted the world tree. 

Evening of September 22nd

We all convene back home and discuss the possibility of going back into the temple to see if that is the source of corruption for the World Scar. We go to talk to KP, remembering the time he fixed the warped stuff that happened in town where Mouthers appeared and ate people. KP says that was caused by a weakened barrier, that has not weakened since. He also warns us not to go into the temple, and we'd be fools to go again. I try and talk him into coming with us, and he agrees, as long as he doesn't have to fight anything. Praetus attempts to help KP find out where he came from, through the help of Lathander. The light bathes him, but doesn't... do... anything. Light doesn't effect him.

We go to sleep.

Morning of September 23rd

Adrian takes over for Praetus today, but is awfully preachy doesn't deliver Lathander's message as well as Praetus would have. I talk about letting your opinions and beliefs being known with the upcoming election. The caravan leaves in 2 hours. We see them off.

I go and ask the hunters is there has been any strange animal activity since Hakour has been away. They said no.

Oz and Praetus go and talk to the dryads, so see if they can glean any information about Parinath or Hakour after getting directions from Keyleth. We come to a clearing, with no one around. Oz tries to talk to the birds around the area, and they just leave. We plan to wait at least an hour. After 50 minutes, a dryad emerges from the tree. Oz casts comprehend languages to speak with it and makes some crappy imitation bird noises. He acid breaths the tree out of frustration when the dryads disappear again.

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We run away, meaning no harm to them. What the fuck, Oz? Praetus heals the tree back to full. Praetus leave Apa'ro in the clearing to try and communicate our desire to talk about Hakour. A dryad requests Praetus and I back in the clearing and that Oz is not welcome. The dryads describe the horrible things that Hakour has done to them: killed their pets, destroyed their homes, and threatened him. They said he talks with Mouthers and other dark beings, that the dragon is a pawn and there is a much bigger evil that Hakour serves. They believe he is unredeemable, and Praetus and I butt heads hard on whether or not all people deserve a second chance. The dryads know that Hakour served one he called his “Piscathcianess” which Oz somewhat understands to mean “fishy sliminess.”

With that, we leave. And make a side trip to Hakour's lair. We found the path that the dragon took to leave his lair, heading west, toward-ish the temple and swamp.

We go home.

Oz trains with the guards with Praetus's help. He fails a little.

We go to sleep.
