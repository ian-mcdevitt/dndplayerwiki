Very early morning of September 14th, 3am

We are in the temple with Shae with many now homeless townsfolk. Shae says she will keep an eye on the eight survivors.

Evanbrooke is Jersey. Temperate climate or whatever.

Praetus questions why Hakour is never around. Shae says this is normal for him, but he does spend time in that clearing Praetus knows about. We fool around with idea of illusionary terrain over a moat or pike wall or something. Praetus and I go back to the farm. Keyleth and Oz go back to the house to sleep. Nothing eventful happens over the course of Praetus's watch until dawn and the stag saw nothing while we were fighting the treants.

6am. Praetus goes and does his dawn thing and we all attend. We brainstorm with the members of the clergy. Oz, Telsa and myself go around detecting magic around the town. Praetus wants to give recognition to Jim (and subsequently force responsibility upon him) for his efforts last night. Hakour makes some crappy excuse about having a meeting with dryads, but insists he will be back for out scheduled noon meeting. Keyleth tries to stealth after him.

Praetus, talking to the clergy, finds that Thor is for erecting a giant wooden wall. He also finds that Hakour would know the most about possible nature/druids goings on, who conveniently ISN'T HERE AND WON'T BE BACK TIL THE MEETING.

Keyleth is SUPER stealthy while following Hakour.

Telsa and I detect magic with Oz in tow. 
Burning bridge – faint aura of magic
Treants – animus lingers in the leader
Jim's – OMG MAGIC OW
Bronzeleafs – faint around garden
Firemaws – faint around their home

In the town center, a giant eagle lands with a scroll (from Tefydarian, the bronze dragon) stating we might have use for the following contents and as a thank you from freeing his mind from the crown, with money and additional scrolls. The three scrolls consist of the stories of: Jyostna, Kaldaka, and Chaundra, once Oz comprehends languages on it. Oz receives a lance that is whispering to him... oh no.

	Jyostna bought power to Zari, the moon spirit. Zari had a Chosen One named Chaundra who 	was powerful and good, and then when Zari fell in the Great War, she became the first lyncan 	and caused much destruction. Then Kaldaka was the redeemer, and resurrected Zari and was the 	last lycan.

Telsa randomly says that once a bear came up to Hakour after being provoked and bit off his finger... but he's not missing any fingers... huh.

Keyleth still following Hakour. Hakour comes upon a clearing, mumbles something she can't understand, and five dryads appear from the forest. She shouts at them, they appear scared, including the one that looks like a leader. She turns on his heels and storms away. Keyleth alters herself and remains unseen. Keyleth continues to follow him, keeping in mind one specific phrase the dryads said, saying it over and over again in her head.

Oz asks Arauthator to speak dead with the treant. Telsa is present as well. Oz, Praetus and I brainstorm what we want to ask the treant. The conversation goes:

	Who summoned you?
	Hakour.
	What were your instructions?
	Chaos.
	Why were you instructed to do this?
	To run the villagers out of town.
	What forces has he gathered?
	I do not know.
	Why did he want to run people out of town?
	I don't know.

Telsa is distraught. Arauthator is in disbelief. Yay we have witnesses! I send to Keyleth telling he to be careful, Hakour is responsible, make sure he comes back to town. Keyleth responds: kk, coming back to town, still following, ETA 2hr, keyleth out.

I enlist a very distraught Telsa to cooridnate efforts to rebuild the homes. Praetus is rallying the clergy. Thor is gearing up (love this man – we can make this work despite intense racism), Shae is emotionally preparing herself. Oz is identifying his lance. It is a Spear of Heaven, a symbol appears on it. The lance communicates emotions to him, and shows up what I saw earlier. The man/werewolf and the pill bug. That vision is the scroll story. Additionally shows him many werewolves from around the world turning back into men.

...this whole Daybrooke farm thing... it's not a werewolf. The curse ended. Hakour suggested the werewolf idea... I hate everything. Did I mention I called it?

Praetus tells Jim to be at the meeting.

We prepare in the temple... just waiting for Hakour. 

He arrives.

Oz slams the door behind him. Praetus casts zone of truth. No effect. Charm. No effect. When questioned, he disappears. Jim tells us he's probably at “his” meadow. He casts fly and we're off.

He's not there. Nor did we see him on the way in. We see his tablet and Oz pushes it over, revealing a staircase descending down. We slide down Praetus's tower shield, Jim laughing at our stupidity. We slide into poisonous mushrooms. They don't affect us. Some bigger mushrooms start approaching us. Oz throws his bleeding tooth mushroom at it. The mushroom's head eats it. 

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT.

We need to figure out what that thing Keyleth memorized was... (psst Ian)
