Magnus Daybrook approaches Praetus about sheep attacks on his farm for the past three months. Praetus goes to investigate a sheep carcass and finds that it is consistent with a werewolf attack.

Praetus then goes to the temple to consult with the other clerics. One confides in him that a man came to confess about being a werewolf. Us three go back to the Daybrooke farm so Oz can talk to sheep. Confirms oddities consistent with a werewolf.

Today is September 4th. the latest wolf attack happened on September 2nd. We plan to camp out from the 14th or until we catch the werewolf.

Oz questions John Farguard, the captain of the town guard, if anything significant happened in the past 3 months. He says the CommonShield brothers (Tristan and Dunkin) joined the guard at that time. Describes them as tardy and energetic boys, enthusiastic about their job. We wonder if there is any correlation between the boys joining the guard and the werewolf attacks.

After finding out about Hakour and Tefydarian's information about werewolves no longer existing, we can only assume that Hakour shapeshifted and was responsible for the incidents, one of his many ploys to scare away the people of Evenbrook.
