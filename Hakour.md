High-Elf Cleric
Priest of Sel√ªne (God of Nature)

Found him to be responsible for all of the calamities that befell Evenbrook in the last 20 years, do to his association with the green dragon, Parinath. 

We found out through some investigatin' that Hakour thought he was hearing "the voice of nature" and that was controlling his actions. Although Praetus is intent on Hakour paying for his crimes, Enna can't help but feel he shouldn't be held responsible. 

While we were dealing with the mindflayer threat deep under the temple in the swamp, Hakour scried for us and presumed that we were up to no good. He notified the town and told them to evacuate as he thought we were coming back with an army to attack Evenbrook. 

Praetus's spirit companion, Apa'ro, helped Hakour find his way, and we confronted each other about what he scried and what Jim told us Hakour was doing. 

Hakour has agreed to aid us in stopping this unknown force that looms over Evenbrook, threatening to destroy the town and it's people.
