Afternoon October 6th

So we had a thought... Utereshk and the Living Gate... and Ushay said something about the Living Gate. Oz rereads the Utereshk ritual, and finds that the Living Gate is preventing something from working. 

Anyway, we know the way to Treehaven, so we head that way. After awhile, we see a flock of birds, and Oz attempts to talk to them. They're useless. We eventually come to a clearing and subsequently, a very high wall, with a guard tower around a tree. Oz attempts to fly over it, but someone calls out in elvish asking who we are Hakour speaks up, saying we would like to talk to the Pinegrove, the tree spirit. An eledrin greets us. He informs us that the Great Tree is sick with some sort of plague, and that if we want to enter, we must help it. We agree. The wood parts and we enter.

We go down a path, into a town center, and around the tree are residences. There are half a dozen eledrin here that quickly snub me for being “low born”. We head right up to the tree. There is a lake nearby, and the water is free of poisons that we can tell. We go talk to Pinegrove. He is inanimate, but Oz detects that he is suffering from root rot. His mouth is open, and big enough for us to enter. And we do so. 

We find ourselves in a large colum of a room, with a long spiral walkway leading up. In the middle of the floor, is a large hole filled with spiderwebs. We look up, and see three door dotted at various points. We decide to explore them, just so we are not ambushed from behind. The walls are covered in the same webs. Upon trying to burn one of them with a torch, it immediately goes out; it's too wet. We reach the top, Prateus looks over the walkway to the center of the tree, and three large flying scorpions surprise us. 

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

We killed the three, after Oz turned Praetus into a giant scorpion. 

The scorpions are from the fey upon inspection. We check the first door. There's a room with an elevated area in the center, with vines on it. It looks like we're entering a branch. Two egg sacs on the ceiling, but we destroy them before they become a problem. Praetus climbs up the vines, and there's a chest. As he opens iiiiiiiiiiit...

FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT

After incapacitating the vine blights, we find a shiny compass at the bottom of the chest that's spinning in random directions. We decide to take a short rest while Oz identifies the compass.
