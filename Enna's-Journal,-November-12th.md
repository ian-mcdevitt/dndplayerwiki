Morning of September 7th

We go to sleep after the town meeting, with a lot on our minds. We wonder if Justin going is really the best idea, despite us needing volunteers. He seems strong and capable of following necessary commands, but doesn't seem like he would be good with something like a sword. We also wonder about the fate of the town and the kidnapped towns-person. 

We wake up and tell Kalt Peter what happened, including the fact that the copper dragon did not act like typical copper dragon. He says it's regrettable, but understandable that we are going after the dragon. He seems distracted.

I go to talk to Tim about him needing to stay in the town to look after his family and assure him that we will come back with Lana.
“Promise me you'll come back.”
“We will.”

Oz goes to talk to Jim the Wizard to question him about copper dragons. Thomas Riverbeard is there and says that Jim has said he's seen dragons before. Oz tried to find a book in Jim's collections about dragons. His book is very small and limited in information.

Praetus and I go to question Hakour about where he was last night. He said he “had duties.” I ask him seriously if he will come with us to say Lana, and scoffs. I try to intimidate him, saying he has a responsibility to his town and people to resolve this issue. He casts “Charm Person” on me and I just walk away smiling. Praetus said what he did was rude and walks away.

We start toward the north, what the huntsman (Amadeus) who agreed to take us 25 miles out of town. He says we should follow the river. He prepares us that animals go crazy for the first 5 miles out. We are okay for awhile. 8-9 miles out, we see a bear and an owlbear fighting – pretty normal. The bear runs away and the owl bear chases, which is uncharacterstic of a territory dispute. We move on. We also notice that the river is flowing too fast for how flat the terrain is. Oz finds poisonous mushrooms.

The ground begins to tremble a bit. It feels like a stampede. Oz and Praetus fail to climb a tree. I make is to the top and see birds flying off trees .5mi to the west, heading right toward us.  Oz goes invisible. Praetus stays still. I stay up the tree. Praetus would have seen a stampede by now. We think it's a bulette.

Praetus smites him and is the real MVP. It's dead.

Bulettes are highly territorial, so another one will take this one's place. We stop and eat some bullette meat.

Another bullete comes, circles the area of trees we're hiding in, and goes away. They're definitely being sent to kill us. We engage it.

Praetus is the real MVP... again. Goddammit, Praetus.

We decide to cut down a tree to cross to the other side of the river and continue north. I dex my way across with a rope to steady the rest and cross. Oz falls in the river, but has the rope, and we drag him in.

We continue on, and nothing more unusual happens. We camp at 5pm. Amadeus says that this island is super weird, and that is shouldn't be like this. He also says the biggest thing he's encountered is a owlbear, but he also could swear he thought he saw a slaad, but he can't be sure. I cast detect magic and find a faint aura of transmutation near the river... what the...?

We go to sleep and take turns watching. Oz spots a family of owlbears during his watch, and he lures them away with his music. Praetus and I wake up, and pet the curious baby owlbears. They break Oz's drums and go away.

Prateus finds during the sunrise that they are no visible mountains. Everything is flat as far as the eye can see. But the river needs to come down from a mountain... Praetus things we need to find a mountain. We agree. Amadeus leaves for home.

The forest gives way to swampland, and then plains. We see birds circling above us. We keep moving. Now we're in deadlands. I send to Amadeus, who is okay. Ferytons attack us. Enna is the real MVP this time. We go to sleep.

Morning of September 8th

 Praetus got a vision of an upside tree in a hallow. He gets the feeling something bad is ahead of us. The river gets more violent, and the ground is sloping down. We can see in the distance an anolmaly: three rivers starting at a giant hole. Transmutation can cause reverse gravity. On the other side of the hole, is a humanoid figure, moving clockwise around the hole. We close the gap. It's Jim the Wizard.

“Hey, Jim, what's your name?”
JAMES EUGENE DARKMAGIC III

He's super excited to be here. Says he's not the source of all this magic, but is building stairs down to the bottom of the hole, despite being able to teleport down. He says there are chuul down in one of the caves. Multiple cave systems; basically an upside cave system, with water coming up out of it.
